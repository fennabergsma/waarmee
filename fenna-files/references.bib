  title = {Ellipsis in {{Dutch Possessive Noun Phrases}}: {{A Micro}}-{{Comparative Approach}}},
  volume = {13},
  abstract = {We discuss ellipsis of the possessee in both pronominal possessor constructions (Dutch: zijn boek `his book') and possessor doubling constructions (Dutch: John z'n boek, John his book `John's book') from a micro-comparative perspective. More specifically we show, on the basis of an in-depth study of the nominal system of 57 Dutch dialects, that there are two types of possessee ellipsis. In the first type there is a pro which needs to be licensed by gender agreement. In the second type there is an overt pro-form, similar to English one, and hence no ellipsis. Dialects that have the first type of possessee ellipsis can be further divided into two subtypes. The first has gender agreement on the possessive pronoun, the second one does not. Interestingly, possessee ellipsis can take place in the possessor doubling construction only in the former subtype of dialect. We implement this striking generalization by arguing that in the latter type of dialect pro has to move to Spec,DP in order to be licensed. The doubling possessor also has to be merged in Spec,DP. As a consequence, pro and a doubling possessor cannot co-occur and hence possessee ellipsis and possessor doubling are incompatible. In the former type of dialect, i.e., those dialects that do express gender on the possessive pronoun, pro can be licensed by the gender agreement on the possessive pronoun in a position lower than Spec,DP. Hence, in these dialects Spec,DP is available for a doubling possessor and, consequently, possessee ellipsis and possessor doubling can co-occur.},

  abstract = {This article investigates the internal syntax of evaluative vocative expressions (e.g., You idiot!). This construction superficially consists of a second person pronoun and an epithet noun. It turns out that this construction type has different morphosyntactic manifestations across languages/dialects (abstractly: youNOM idiot!; youACC/OBL idiot!; your idiot!). The paper aims at giving a uniform account for the `underlying' syntax of this construction type. It is argued that this construction has the `underlying' syntax of a possessive noun phrase. More particularly, the second person pronoun starts out as (part of) a PP-predicate and undergoes leftward predicate displacement within the vocative noun phrase. The major dimensions of (morpho)syntactic diversity are related to the following properties: (1) the nature of the predicate displacement operation involved (i.e., predicate inversion and/or predicate fronting); (2) the overtness versus covertness of the small clause head X, which is part of the vocative expression; (3) the case form of the second person pronoun. According to the structural analysis proposed in this article, evaluative vocative expressions form a further illustration of the structural uniformity that is hidden behind superficial diversity.},

This is an unusual enterprise within typology, and it requires a `canonical' approach. That is, I define the canonical or best instance, through a set of converging criteria, and use this point in theoretical space to locate the various occurring types. Thus the criteria establish the dimensions along which specific instances of suppletion are found, allowing me to calibrate examples out from the canonical. The criteria fall into two main areas, those internal to the lexeme and those external to it. Moreover, I find interactions with other morphological phenomena and discuss four of them: syncretism, periphrasis, overdifferentiation, and reduplication. These remarkable instances of suppletion, particularly when in interaction with other phenomena, extend the boundary of the notion `possible word'. Besides laying out the possibilities for the specific phenomenon of suppletion, I show how a canonical approach allows progress in typology, even in the most challenging areas.},

The proposed analysis is uniform across veridical and non-veridical readings of before and brings under the semantic fold seemingly exceptional or pragmatically-based cases of NPI licens- ing observed with after, since and until. Crucial throughout is the more restricted, presupposition-dependent notion of entailment, Strawson entailment, proposed by von Fintel (1999). The paper also relates Strawson entailment to the alternative-based analysis of NPIs by Krifka (1995), proposing a particular kind of contextual update, Strawson update, for calculating informational strength.},

  abstract = {Spears 1998 discusses a use of the word ass in African American English (AAE) in sentences like They done arrested her stupid ass and I'm gonna sue her ass. We refer to DPs like her stupid ass generically as the ACC (ass CAMOUFLAGE CONSTRUCTION), and we view the ACC as an instance of a universal grammatical phenomenon we call CAMOUFLAGE. The ACC is also attested in non- AAE dialects of American English (Beavers \& Koontz-Garboden 2006a). For certain syntactic properties, the possessor of the ACC behaves as if it were external to the larger DP (e.g. binding, control, selection); for others, it behaves as if it were internal to the larger DP (e.g. finite verb agreement, traditional constituent-structure tests). To account for this dual behavior, we propose that the ACC possessor DP originates in a position external to the ACC, and moves into its possessor position. We discuss the implications of our analysis for other areas of AAE syntax, including the resumptive-with construction, a previously undocumented grammatical phenomenon, and the use of self in various constructions, which we suggest are illuminated by the notion camouflage. We briefly consider arguable instances of camouflage crosslinguistically in languages such as Georgian, French, the Mayan languages K'ekchi and Tzotzil, and Yoruba. Genuine similarities between the ACC and these other constructions support our perspective on the ACC.},

This structure is analysed in a minimalist framework, leading to a revision of the minimialist theory of locality constraints on movement. Evidence is presented to show that the subject remains in Spec-V and the verb raises to Agro in quotative inversion sentences. The direct speech constituent at the periphery of the clause is shown to control an empty operator which triggers the inversion in a manner parallel to French stylistic inversion. The inversion is derived from the checking theory by supposing a particular complementiser type which then selects weak N-features on its complement. A transitivity constraint on quotative inversion is discussed and the Minimal Link Condition is reformulated so that inversion is blocked in VPs in which there is both a quote and a DP complement. Finally, the position of the verb in quotative inversion is derived from the Revised Minimal Link Condition.},

  abstract = {This paper describes the formation of yes/no (Y/N) questions in colloquial Singapore Teochew (ST), a variety of Teochew (Chaozhou) which has borrowed a significat number of lexical items from Malay. The varieties of Y/N questions which we shall describe are A-Not-A questions, questions employing the question particle ka and postposed negative auxiliary (PNA) questions. The three types of Y/N questions can be reduced to two types, A-Not-A questions and ka questions. These two types of questions differ markedly in their propoerties. Ka questions show distributional limitations which indicate that they are derived similarly to adverbial WH questions, suggesting a movement analysis like that proposed by Huang (1982 and 1991) for Mandarin and Taiwanese A-Not-A questions. ST A-Not-A quesitons, however, appear not to be derived by movement. Rather, we follow McCawley's suggestion that A-Not-A questions represent the conventionalization and grammaticization of what earlier were not Y/N questions, but rather alternative or disjunctive questions.},

  volume = {14},
  abstract = {It has been claimed widely that in Indonesian the most frequent type of relative clause, that formed with the complementizer yang and with a gap in place of the relativized NP, is restricted to subject relativization. We challenge this claim and argue that complementizer/gap direct object relativization is also well formed. Furthermore, we argue against the proposal that the grammar of Indonesian contains a stipulation that complementizer/gap relativization is restricted to subjects and direct objects. Rather, the appearance of constraints which conform to the Accessibility Hierarchy of Keenan and Comrie [Linguist. Inquiry 8 (1977) 63] is due to the interaction of ECP-like restrictions on extraction with the structure of various clause types in Indonesian. Specifically, Indonesian exhibits a VP shell structure along the lines of Larson [Linguist. Inquiry 19 (1988) 335], which predicts the extraction facts. While the resulting distribution appears to conform to the Accessibility Hierarchy, there does not appear to be any motivation on the basis of the facts of Indonesian to attribute to the Accessibility Hierarchy an independent role in the grammar. Rather, the appearance of conformity to the Accessibility Hierarchy is epiphenomenal.},

The paper examiens the prinicples that account for overt wh-movement, wh-in-situ and partial wh-movement in Malay. We argue that the apparent optionality seen in Malay reduces to whether, in the lexicon, a question word consists of an operator and variable combined in a single word, or of a variable bound by a separate, phonologically null operator. We then apply the analysis based on Malay to other langauges (primarily, to Chinese and English), and show that the principles employed for Malay are sufficient to explain the variation in wh-question formation among these languages.},

(2) Extraction of direct objects/ passive agents (by relativization, etc.) is ungrammatical, but subjects, IOs, and adverbials can be extracted. (3) In Toba Batak anaphoric binding, the active subject can bind a passive subject. We argue that these facts are explained by an analysis in which V-O-S-IO order is derived by VP-raising and in which the passive agent is an argument, generated as the specifier of vP rather than as an adjunct. Furthermore, the passive subject undergoes optional reconstruction to its base-generated position in VP. We also argue that, although c-command relations among elements of vP are critical, linear order plays no role whatsoever in the base structure. That is, the output of Merge can be unordered lineraly, and it can be shown that all surface word orders in Toba Batak can be derived from various movement rules out of an unordered base. Linear order comes into play only when constituents move out of hte vP to higher functional projections, linear order being simply a by-product of Move.},

A generic may be false even if the vast majority of individuals in its domain satisfy the predicated property, whereas a frequency statement using, e.g., usuallywould be true.

  abstract = {In this paper we show that focus structure determines the interpretation of bare plurals in English: topic bare plurals are interpreted generically, focused bare plurals are interpreted existentially. When bare plurals are topics they must be specific, i.e. they refer to kinds. After type-shifting they introduce variables which can be bound by the generic quantifier, yielding characterizing generics. Existentially interpreted bare plurals are not variables, but denote properties that are incorporated into the predicate. They type of predicate determines the interpretation of its bare plural subject. The individual/stage-level distinction, though important, is not sufficient: since only arguments can be topics, only those stage-level predicates which have locative arguments can have existential bare plural subjects. Certain verbs (e.g., $\backslash$emphhate) fail to incorporate their bare plural objects; therefore no existential reading of the object is available. We provide a novel solution to this puzzle based on the following two claims: (i) incorporated bare plurals do not introduce discourse referents; (ii) nonincorporating verbs are presuppositional.},

The criterion for salience of a chunk is cognitive: it is dependent onthe way in which the domain is mentally represented. Findings of psychologicalexperiments about the ways in which different domains are represented, and thefactors affecting such representations, account for judgments of generic sentences,facts which cannot be explained by linguistics alone.The reason for the homogeneity requirement itself is, in turn, also dependenton cognitive considerations. Generics express default rules, and psychologicalfindings have shown that, the more homogeneous the domain, the easier it isfor subjects to infer rules about it. Thus, cognitive results form a crucial part of a comprehensive account of the meaningof a linguistic expression.},

  title = {Existential {{Generics}}},
  volume = {27},
  abstract = {While opinions on the semantic analysis of generics vary widely, most scholars agree that generics have a quasi-universal flavor. However, there are cases where generics receive what appears to be an existentialinterpretation. For example, B''s response is true, even though only theplatypus and the echidna lay eggs: (1) A: Birds lay eggs. B: Mammals lay eggs too. In this paper I propose a uniform account of the semantics of generics,which accounts for their quasi-existential readings as well as for their more familiar quasi-universal ones. Generics are focus-sensitiveoperators: their domain is restricted by a set of alternatives, which may be provided by focus. I claim that, unlike otherfocus-sensitive operators, generics may, but do not have to, associate with focus. When alternatives are introduced, either by focus or by other means, generics get their usual quasi-universal readings. But when no alternatives are introduced, quasi-existential readings result.I argue that generics, unlike adverbs of quantification, do not introduce tripartite structures directly, but are initially interpreted as cases ofdirect kind predication. Only when this interpretation fails to make sense, the phonologically null generic quantifier is derived, and tripartite structures result. This two-level interpretation has the effect that while adverbs of quantification require focus to determine which elements go to the restrictor and which to the nuclear scope, and hence must associate with focus, generics do not, and hence may fail to associate with focus, resulting in quasi-existential readings.},

As in Arabic, the restriction applies gradiently: its force depends on the place of articulation of the consonants involved, and on whether the homorganic consonants are similar in terms of other features. Muna differs from Arabic in the relative strengths of these other features in affecting co-occurrence rates of homorganic consonants. Along with the descriptions of these patterns, this paper presents phonological analyses in terms of weighted constraints, as in Harmonic Grammar. This account uses a gradual learning algorithm that acquires weights that reflect the relative frequency of different sequence types in the two languages. The resulting grammars assign the sequences acceptability scores that correlate with a measure of their attestedness in the lexicon. This application of Harmonic Grammar illustrates its ability to capture both gradient and categorical patterns.},

  volume = {28},
  abstract = {Bertrand Russell introduced several novel ideas in his 1903 Principles of Mathematics that he later gave up and never went back to in his subsequent work. Two of these are the related notions of denoting concepts and classes as many. In this paper we reconstruct each of these notions in the framework of conceptual realism and connect them through a logic of names that encompasses both proper and common names, and among the latter, complex as well as simple common names. Names, proper or common, and simple or complex, occur as parts of quantifier phrases, which in conceptual realism stand for referential concepts, i.e., cognitive capacities that inform our speech and mental acts with a referential nature and account for the intentionality, or directedness, of those acts. In Russell's theory, quantifier phrases express denoting concepts (which do not include proper names). In conceptual realism, names, as well as predicates, can be nominalized and allowed to occur as ``singular terms'', i.e., as arguments of predicates. Occurring as a singular term, a name denotes, if it denotes at all, a class as many, where, as in Russell's theory, a class as many of one object is identical with that one object, and a class as many of more than one object is a plurality, i.e., a plural object that we call a group. Also, as in Russell's theory, there is no empty class as many. When nominalized, proper names function as ``singular terms'' just the way they do in so-called free logic. Lesniewski's ontology, which is also called a logic of names can be completely interpreted within this conceptualist framework, and the well-known oddities of Lesniewski's system are shown not to be odd at all when his system is so interpreted. Finally, we show how the pluralities, or groups, of the logic of classes as many can be used as the semantic basis of plural reference and predication. We explain in this way Russell's ``fundamental doctrine upon which all rests'', i.e., ``the doctrine that the subject of a proposition may be plural, and that such plural subjects are what is meant by classes [as many] which have more than one term'' (Russell 1938, p. 517).},

Two long-standing ideas, (i) that proper names have no sense, and (ii) that they are expressions whose purpose is to refer to individuals, cannot be made to work comprehensively while PROPER is understood as a subcategory of linguistic units, whether of lexemes or phrases. Phrases of the type the old vicarage, which are potentially ambiguous with regard to properhood, encourage the suggestion that PROPER is best understood as a mode of reference contrasting with SEMANTIC reference; in the former, the intension/sense of any lexical items within the referring expression, and any entailments they give rise to, are canceled. PROPER NAMES are all those expressions that refer nonintensionally. Linguistic evidence is given that this opposition can be grammaticalized, a speculation is made about its neurological basis, and psycholinguistic evidence is adduced in support. The PROPER NOUN, as a lexical category, is argued to be epiphenomenal on proper names as newly defined. Some consequences of the view that proper names have no sense in the act of reference are explored; they are not debarred from having senses (better: synchronic etymologies) accessible during other (meta)linguistic activities.},

Fur- ther, in a small pilot study directly comparing a sentence with adjacent final wh-phrases that may induce a stress clash ( I'd like to know who hid it where when ) with a sentence violating Superiority but avoiding the final adjacent wh-phrases ( I'd like to know where who hid it when ), half the participants indicated that the Superiority violation sentence sounded better. This suggests that the status of some additional-wh sentences may appear to improve simply because the comparison sen- tence with adjacent final wh-phrases is degraded. Overall, the results of the studies suggest that there is no need to complicate syntactic theory to account for the additional-wh effect, because there is no general additional-wh effect.},

Such relatives, which I will refer to as light-headed relatives, are the topic of this paper. They are headed by morphologically 'light elements', and tend to differ from their headed counterparts with respect to relative pronoun or relative complementizer selection.},

Focusing on Slavic languages, which allow both ATB movement and left-branch extraction in isolation, it shows that ATB left-branch extraction is subject to a rather surprising restriction: the remnants inside the second conjunct must be distinct from their correspondents inside the first conjunct. The account of this restriction developed in this paper relies on the interaction of two independently motivated principles: the Linear Correspondence Axiom of Kayne 1994 and a structural economy condition formulated within the framework of Chomsky's (1995) Minimalist Program.},

We offer an account of the semantics of these forms within a situation semantics, addressing a number of theoretically interesting questions about how to realize a semantics for tense and events in that type of framework. We argue that each of these forms is unambiguous, and that the apparent variety of readings attested for them derives from interaction with other factors in the course o finterpretation. The meaning of the imperfecto is constrained to always reflect atelic aktionsart. In addition, it contains a modal element, and a contextually-given accessibility relation over situations constrains the interpretation of the modal in ways that give rise to all the attested readings. The pret\'erito is indeterminate with respect to aktionsart, neither telic nor atelic. One or the other aktionsart may be forced by other factors in the clause in which the pret\'erito occurs, as well as by pragmatic contrast with the possibility of using the imperfecto.},

This morpheme, sometimes pronounced much, semantically contributes a structure-preserving map from entities, events, or states, to their measures along various dimensions. A major goal of the paper is to argue that the differences in dimensionality observed across domains are a consequence of what is measured, as opposed to which expression introduces the measurement. The resulting theory has a number of interesting properties. It characterizes the notion of `measurement' uniformly across comparative constructions, in terms of non-trivial structure preservation. It unifies the distinctions between mass/count nouns and atelic/telic verb phrases with that between gradable and non-gradable adjectives. Finally, it affords a uniform characterization of semantically anomalous comparisons across categories.},

  doi = {10.1023/A:1009763305416},
  abstract = {The question addressed here is whether there is a systematic relationship between the internal structure of syntactic phrases and their distribution in the clause. To account for the internal coherence of syntactic phrases, their endocentricity, I develop the notion of 'extended projections' in two ways. First, evidence from two constructions of German and Dutch argues that in addition to lexical heads and functional heads, also semi-lexical heads must be introduced. The notion of categorial identity, which states that the syntactic nodes connecting the lexical and functional heads within an extended projection with the phrasal node must all be of the same category type, is shown to hold for semi-lexical heads as well. Second, the notion of 'extended projection' will be modified to accommodate the fact that prepositional elements can often be inserted within an extended projection. This exceptional status of prepositional elements is reminiscent of the fact that prepositional phrases are arguably the most flexible phrases in terms of their distribution. In earlier work, I had suggested that this fact could be expressed in terms of a constraint, the Unlike Feature Constraint, which was formulated in terms of repulsion between the positive values of the categorial features: a [+N/V] head does not tolerate a [+N/V] phrase in its immediate domain. Categorial identity is now interpreted as the mutual attraction of the positive categorial feature values: we have attraction within, but repulsion across phrasal categories. And in both cases, prepositions are the neutral element. This idea leads to a unified principle, the Law of Categorial Feature Magnetism.},

  abstract = {The question of whether wh-in situ stays in situ, or undergoes some form of covert wh-movement that parallels overt wh-movement, remains controversial despite decades of research. We present data from Vietnamese which indicate that wh-in situ can be interpreted by either covert movement or unselective binding without movement. Covert movement takes place in matrix questions that lack a question particle, while unselective binding is used when there is a question particle and in embedded questions generally. The Vietnamese data also show that covert movement observes the same constraints\textemdash{}in particular, Subjacency\textemdash{}as overt movement. The correlation between unselective binding and the question particle in matrix questions appears to support recent theoretical views of question particles (e.g., Cheng, 1991), but we argue that this is only apparent. The question particle merely serves a syntactic licensing function, and this function is borne by a question- embedding verb in embedded questions, meaning that it is not inherent to question particles as such. The question particle in Vietnamese actually serves an unrelated semantic function: it indicates realis mood and induces a presupposition. The implication is that question particles are only indirectly related to wh-in situ, if they are related at all.},

  abstract = {WH-words in Korean can have either a question word or an existential indefinite interpretation. The WH-subject Nwukwu who in can be ambiguous between a WH-Question reading and a WH-indefinite reading. The WH-word can also be used in a declarative sentence as a WH-indefinite. Certain previous literature (Chung 1996; Jang and Kim 1996; Jang 1999) has distinguished the WH-Question reading from the WH-indefinite reading in terms of an indirect question analysis. Under this view, when the WH-word is bound by a Q-operator, then it has the WH-Question reading. However, the view that the indefinite reading arises from an embedded question has some empirical problems. In this paper, I will show that the WH-compound form (WH+be+Q) has different scope-taking relations from the bare WH-existential form (WH-\O{}). And I will explain this scopal difference using a choice function mechanism: namely, the Q-particle in WH+Qparticle forms introduces a choice function to WH-words.},

  abstract = {It is generally assumed that hierarchical phrase structure plays a central role in human language. However, considerations of simplicity and evolutionary continuity suggest that hierarchical structure should not be invoked too hastily. Indeed, recent neurophysiological, behavioural and computational studies show that sequential sentence structure has considerable explanatory power and that hierarchical processing is often not involved. In this paper, we review evidence from the recent literature supporting the hypothesis that sequential structure may be fundamental to the comprehension, production and acquisition of human language. Moreover, we provide a preliminary sketch outlining a non-hierarchical model of language use and discuss its implications and testable predictions. If linguistic phenomena can be explained by sequential rather than hierarchical structure, this will have considerable impact in a wide range of fields, such as linguistics, ethology, cognitive neuroscience, psychology and computer science.},

  abstract = {The adjectives of quantity (Q-adjectives) many, few, much and little stand out from other quantity expressions on account of their syntactic flexibility, occurring in positions that could be called quantificational (many students attended), predicative (John's friends were many), attributive (the many students), differential (much more than a liter) and adverbial (slept too much). This broad distribution poses a challenge for the two leading theories of this class, which treat them as either quantifying determiners or predicates over individuals. This article develops an analysis of Q-adjectives as gradable predicates of sets of degrees or (equivalently) gradable quantifiers over degrees. It is shown that this proposal allows a unified analysis of these items across the positions in which they occur, while also overcoming several issues facing competing accounts, among others the divergences between Q-adjectives and `ordinary' adjectives, the operator-like behavior of few and little, and the use of much as a dummy element. Overall the findings point to the central role of degrees in the semantics of quantity.},

  abstract = {Reporting on a study of 79 languages (see appendix B), I argue that (morpho)syntactic structure plays a crucial role in two observed asymmetries: (a) in nouns, number-driven root suppletion is common while case-driven root suppletion is virtually unattested, and (b) in contrast to lexical nouns, pronouns commonly supplete for both number and case. I propose that the structural difference between lexical nouns and pronouns, combined with locality effects as proposed in Distributed Morphology (DM; Halle and Marantz 1993), accounts for the two asymmetries. This raises the question whether these asymmetries can be captured in frameworks that deny that hierarchical syntactic structure plays a role in the morphology, such as word-and-paradigm approaches (e.g., Anderson 1992, Stump 2001).

  abstract = {This paper explores the cross-linguistics status of the so-called Wh-scope-marker strategy of wide scope assignment through the study of its instantiation in Hungarian, assessing the role and distribution of the expletive-like Wh-element (what). After establishing the existence of the construction in Hungarian via novel types of arguments, a variety of evidence is presented showing the inadequacy of the leading analysis of Wh-expletive constructions with overt partial Wh-movement: proposals based on the formation of a Wh-chain linking the scope-marking Wh-expletive in the higher Spec with the partially moved contentful Wh-phrase, in a way that mimics overt full Wh-movement chains (originating in McDaniel's (1989) work on German and Romani, assumed subsequently, with some modifications, e.g. by Rizzi (1992), Brody (1993), McDaniel, Chiu and Maxfield (1995) and M\$ࡱ\$''uller (1995)). I motivate an alternative account, falling within the general framework of an indirect Wh-dependency approach proposed by Dayal (e.g. 1994, based on the in-situ Wh of Hindi). I argue that the scope-marker of Hungarian is not an A-bar expletive, but an expletive element generated in an A-position which has a CP as its associate, and which undergoes (overt) movement to an A-bar position due to being a Wh-morpheme. The construction is shown to arise as a by-product of independently motivated processes: (a) Wh-feature percolation from Spec, as in (clausal) pied-piping cases, and (b) an expletive-CP association, argued to be due to needs inherent to clausal complementation in the language and independent of any Wh-feature or scope-assignment. In spite of the shared indirect Wh-dependency concept and the assumption of CP being the 'associate', Dayal's particular analysis (1994) is shown to be empirically distinct from mine, and to be untenable for Hungarian, as well as for German. An initial three-way comparison of Hungarian vs. Hindi vs. German suggests that (at least) the syntactic implementation of the Wh-expletive strategy is different in each of the three languages. So contrary to tearlier conceptions, this phenomenon does not arise from some unitary parametric source, such as the availability of a Wh-expletive morpheme; rather it seems to be parasitic on independent syntactic properties exhibited by the individual languages.},

  abstract = {Bilingual individuals need effective mechanisms to prevent interference between their languages. Using event-related brain potentials (ERPs) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we present evidence for interference of phonological information from the nontarget language in German\textendash{}Spanish bilinguals. A tacit picture-naming task was used in which bilinguals and monolinguals had to make speeded responses based on the first letter of the picture's name in the target language. In one condition, subjects were required to respond when the name began with a vowel and to withhold a response if it started with a consonant. Stimuli had been selected such that in half of the trials, the names in both languages necessitated the same response, whereas in the other half, responses were different for the two languages. For the bilinguals, the language in which the stimuli had to be named was changed after each block. Bilinguals showed phonological interference compared with monolingual p},

  abstract = {Do the neural circuits that subserve language acquisition lose plasticity as they become tuned to the maternal language? We tested adult subjects born in Korea and adopted by French families in childhood; they have become fluent in their second language and report no conscious recollection of their native language. In behavioral tests assessing their memory for Korean, we found that they do not perform better than a control group of native French subjects who have never been exposed to Korean. We also used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging to monitor cortical activations while the Korean adoptees and native French listened to sentences spoken in Korean, French and other, unknown, foreign languages. The adopted subjects did not show any specific activations to Korean stimuli relative to unknown languages. The areas activated more by French stimuli than by foreign stimuli were similar in the Korean adoptees and in the French native subjects, but with relatively larger extents of activation in the latter group.

With certain DP complements a $\backslash$emphwant to have DP paraphrase of $\backslash$emphwant DP is ill formed; the correct paraphrase uses $\backslash$emphget or $\backslash$emphgive. To allow for this, Fodor and Lepore would have to vary the introduced verb depending on the meaning of the DP, but this would make their proposal ``co-compositional,'' defeating its original purpose. If $\backslash$emphhave, $\backslash$emphget, and $\backslash$emphgive all contain the abstract preposition P\_have (Harley 1995, Richards 2001), however, Fodor and Lepore's treatment may be appropriately revised: the element introduced by $\backslash$emphwant is not $\backslash$emphhave but P\_have. Fodor and Lepore can avoid co-compositionality at the price of allowing lexical decomposition.},

Like the demonstrative phrase, the pronoun is not equivalent to Evans' E-type paraphrase, nor to either the weak or the strong reading sometimes claimed for donkey sentences. A consequence is to narrow the range of formal analyses.},

  abstract = {This paper undertakes an analysis of the word order characteristics of hentai kambun, the archaic Japanese writing style employed for recording Japanese in a way that outwardly resembles Chinese. AS a method of writing Japanese, however, hentai kambun differs conspicuously from standard classical Chinese. Traditional accounts of these deviations tend to treat them as random mistakes in Chinese grammar due to influence from the writer's native Japanese. In contrast to this, the current paper views hentai kambun as a systematic representation of Japanese, rather than as an imitation of Chinese. Specifically, I propose that hentai kambun word order can recieve a systematic account by assuming that Japanese has underlying head-initial word order, as proposed by Kayne (1994) and Whitman (2000), and that hentai kambun is a represenation of this underlying order. This paper further investigates word order in ditransitive clauses and finds that the hentai kambun represenation of dative-accusative and accusative-dative word order alternation provides evidence that what is traditionally referred to as "short scrambling" can in fact be analyzed as base-generation, as proposed in Miyagawa (1997).},

It therefore has significant connections to markedness theoyr, sharing properties with other domains where markedness is relevant and showing context-dependence. In contrast, morphological fixed segmentism is a kid of affixation, and so it resembles affixign morphology generally, The two types are contrasted, and claims about impossible patterns of fixed segmentism are developed.},

In this article, I argue that this distinction is equally important in explaining the observation in CupeA+-o that inherent accent in roots takes precedence over inherent accent in affixes. In addition, morphologically dispersed faithfulness is shown to be instrumental in extending the analysis beyond previous accounts, providing the right tools for the analysis of pre-accentuation and the special phonology of the nominalizer suffix.},

The result of this procedure is a grammar in which general rules exist alongside more specific, but more reliable, generalizations describing subregularities for the same process. I present results from a nonce-probe (WUG) experiment in Italian, in which speakers rated the acceptability ofnovel infinitives in various conjugation classes.

Right-alignment, on the other hand, is not the result of an alignment constraint, but the consequence of the rhythmical constraints *CLASH and *LAPSE demanding alternating rhythm.

Some simple constraints on obviation provide interesting analyses of key facts in Algonquian. Once certain language-particular differences are recognized, a number of syntactici problems in two unrelated languages, Tzotzil (Mayan) and Chamorro (Western Austronesian), yield easily to solutions based on obviation, despite the absence of obviative-based morphology in either language. Hierarchy alignmnet constraints play a central role in the analysis. The account is articulated within optimality theory, which provides an appropriate framework for representing the fact that these languges must select from their resources for expressing transitive propositions the optimal mode of expression for each such proposition.},

The present paper explores how Silverstin's generalization might be expressed in a formal theory of grammar, and how it can play a role in individual grammars. The account, which focuses here on the role of person, is developed in Optimality Theory. Central to it are two formal devices which have been proposed in connection with phonology: harmonic alignment of prominence scales, and local conjunction of constraints. It is shown that application of harmonic alignment to scales involving syntactic relations and several substantive dimensions characterizes the universal markedness relations operative in this domain, and provides the constraints necessary for grammar construction. Differences between languages can be described as differences in the ranking of universal constraints.},

On the absolute reading, the heights of the relevant mountains in a relevant context are compared; on the com- parative reading, relevant climbers' achievements of mountain climbing are compared (Szabolcsi, Comparative superlatives, MIT Working Papers in Linguistics, 1986). Two theories have been proposed regarding this ambiguity. One theory holds that it results from movement of the superlative morpheme -est (movement theory) (Heim, Association with focus, Doctoral Dissertation, 1985, Notes on superlatives, 1999; Szabolcsi 1986). The other theory holds that the ambiguity is derived by assignment of different values to the context variable C, keeping a single LF structure where -est stays in situ (in-situ theory) (Farkas and Kiss, Nat Lang Linguist Theory 18:417\textendash{}455, 2000; Sharvit and Stateva, Linguist Philos 25:453\textendash{}504, 2002). As is pointed out by Heim (1999), a choice between these theories is hard to make based solely on English. Through an investigation of Japanese superlative constructions, this paper argues that, in Japanese at least, a movement theory is required.},

The central question is whether the preceding sentential context can influence access of lexical meaning in on-going sentence comprehension. Previous studies have concentrated on lexical ambiguity resolution of nouns. These studies, on teh whole, have demonstrated that the lexical access system operates independently of previous sentential context. However, previous psycholinguistic work on semantic change suggests that verbs are more susceptible to coercive change than nouns. I explore the possibility that this susceptibility of verbs to semantic change will allow sentential context to influence their lexical access. I find, instead, that the lexical access system still operates independently of preceding sentential context. Teh implications of this finding are presented in terms of two different views of cognitive processing \textendash{} the modular and the interactionist view.},

Levin (1978, 1979 [main text]) concludes, however, that Pseudogapping is transformationally unrelated to both Gapping and VPE. We argue that this conclusion is only partially correct. Gapping and Pseudogapping are transformationally related in that they both involve the application of verb movement, in particular sideward movement of the main verb. We take Johnson's (1994) ATB Movement analysis of Gapping as an important precedent in this regard, and we draw from proposals of Nunes (2001) and Nunes and Uriagereka (2000) for the possibility of sideward movement out of coordinate structures and adjunct clauses. After pursuing the sideward movement approach to Pseudogapping (and ultimately Gapping as well), we outline some important empirical differences between Pseudogapping and VPE that we think raise substantial problems for any analysis that treats Pseudogapping and VPE on a par (e.g., Jayaseelan 1990, Lasnik 1995, 1999a, 1999b). We present evidence for a fundamental syntactic difference between Pseudogapping and VPE, and conclude that the VPE analysis of Pseudogapping cannot be maintained.},

The crucial diagnostics are not locality effets, but identity effects. We implement the base-genearation analysis using a small set of semantically interpretable features, together with a simple universal syntax-semantics correspondence. We show that parametric varition arises because of the different ways the features are bundled on functional heads. We further argue that it is the bundling of two features on a single lexical item, together with the correspondence that requires them to be interpreted apart, that is presponsible for the displacement property of human languages.},

This provides a direct counterexample to the standard view that Italian-style pro drop is subject to a condition of grammatical recoverability (in that the features of pro must be indexed on the verb). However, pro drop in Early Modern Dutch is subject to very strict pragmatic conditions, and this, we argue, does follow from the lack of rich agreement. Basing ourselves on Mira Ariel's Accessibility Theory, we argue that if fewer features of an omitted subject are grammatically recoverable, its antecedent must be more salient in discourse. Consequently, there is an indirect relation between rich agreement and pro drop: rich agreement facilitates pro drop in more contexts. Since a very limited distribution of pro drop implies that the rule is vulnerable in diachronic development, the familiar cross-linguistic generalization can be derived.},

Apparent counterexamples to this claim can be shown to involve aspect/Aktionsarten rather than tense. There is consequently no reason to posit any of the funcitonal shell strucure associated wtih tense. Hence, the infinitival markers ($\backslash$emphzu, $\backslash$emphte) may be assumed to be in (or close to) the VP. This is in accordance with the observation that these infintival markers are always directly adjacent to the verb, which makes them similar to the verbal participial prefix $\backslash$emphge-. A Minimalist account of $\backslash$emphzu/te, which is similar but not identical to $\backslash$emphge-, is proposed. The question is then raised how $\backslash$emphzu (originally a true local-allative preposition) could have become a verbal prefix, and relevant diachronic data are adduced. Finally it is shown that a functionalist, or `cognitivist', theory of grammaticalization like Haspelmath's misses the point in a number of ways. A more formalist theory of `grammaticalizing reanlysis' is proposed as a better alternative.},

It is argued that the Saramaccan form `fu' represents two complementizers typels `fu1', which encodes irrealis mood under Force, and fu2, which realized deontic modality under Finiteness. The same holds for the Gungbe conditional complementizer ni1, which merges under Force, and ni2, which expresses deontic modality under Fin.

  abstract = {While a consensus has been reached about the monoclausality of the Romance construction with an auxiliary verb and its verbal complement, questions remain about its syntactic structure. We focus here on French auxiliaries\textemdash{}the past tense auxiliaries (avoir and e?tre), and the passive auxiliary (e?tre)\textemdash{}which are unique in French in contributing only tense and aspect and triggering obligatory clitic climbing. Three syntactic structures have been proposed for such auxiliaries: a VP complement analysis, a verbal complex analysis, and a `flat' VP analysis. We show here, working within a HEAD-DRIVEN PHRASE STRUCTURE GRAMMAR framework and basing our arguments on classical constituency tests, bounded dependencies, and lesser-known properties of a subset of manner adverbs, that the flat-structure analysis is to be preferred for tense auxiliaries, which take as their complements the bare participle as well as the complements subcategorized by this participle and `inherited' from it. In contrast, the passive auxiliary, which we identify with the copula, has a predicative complement with different realizations: either an ordinary phrase, `saturated' for its complements, or a `partial' complement, where the predicative head lets some or all of its complements be inherited by the auxiliary. Our analysis allows for a solution to the well-known problem of auxiliary selection, which, we argue, should not be taken as an indicator of syntactic structure but is best handled via lexical constraints.},

  abstract = {Jayaseelan (1990) and Lasnik and Saito (1991) observe that English Gapping exhibits properties typical of rightward movement. In this paper, we address the question of why this is the case. We propose that in Gapping, a contrasted element in the full-fledged conjunct can move leftward or rightward to create a structure for copying and that illegitimate derivations are excluded by independently motivated constraints. As one such constraint, we adopt Saito's (1985) condition on adjunction sites, which requires that an element adjoin to the side of the category which is opposite to the head. Since Saito's constraint relies on the head parameter, this analysis makes the obvious prediction that Gapping constructions in head-final languages should involve leftward movement. We show that this is indeed the case with Japanese. The most important theoretical consequences are: (i) that the directionality of adjunction is constrained in LF in the same way as in overt syntax and (ii) that constraints such as the Right Roof constraint and the Subjacency Condition apply both in overt syntax and in LF. The other important consequence is that P-stranding is universally allowed at LF for leftward movement but not for rightward movement.},

We propose that vehicle change effects (in the sense articulated by Fiengo and May (1994)) establish empirical grounds for distinguishing among these alternatives and argue that only the Move F approach can account for the data without enriching the theoretical apparatus.},

Lebanese Arabic distinguishes between tru resumption, where a pronoun or an epithet phrase is related to an A'-antecedent via Move. Only apparent resumption displays reconstruction effects for scope and binding. As resumptives, strong pronouns and epithet phrases cannot be related to a quantificational antecedent unless they occur inside islands. We account for this Obviation Requirement as follwos: (a) (true) resumption is a last resort device, (b) strong pronouns and epithet phrases in apparent resumption contexts are generated as appositive modifiers of a DP, which is fronted to an A'-position, and (c) appositive modifiers are interpreted as independent clauses. Obviation is reduced to the inability of quantifiers to bind a pronominal element across sentential boundaries.},

Based on this generalization, we argue that epithet phrases are not intrinsically pronominal. Rather, it is the anaphoric pronominal element which occurs with those epithet phrases that accounts for their pronominal behavior. We discuss the cross-linguistic consequences of this claim by examining the behavior of epithet phrases in a language, Moroccan Arabic, where epithet phrases cannot be used anaphorically as bound variables or as resumptive elements. Furthermore, the distribution of epithet phrases is regulated by a constraint htat prevents these elements from being linked to the most local operator. This restriction is responsible for the limited distribution of resumptive epithet phrases, and its effects could mislead one into assuming that epithet phrses cannot be used as resumptive elements.},

  abstract = {This article presents two on-line self-paced reading studies and three off-line acceptability judgment studies on the processing of backward anaphoric dependencies in Japanese in which a pronoun precedes potential antecedent noun phrases. The studies investigate the real-time formation of coreference relations and operator-variable binding relations to determine whether speakers of head-final languages are able to construct grammatically accurate syntactic structures before they encounter a verb. The results of the acceptability rating studies confirm previous claims that backwards anaphoric dependencies in Japanese are more acceptable in configurations where a pronoun has been fronted via scrambling from a position where it would be c-commanded by its antecedent. The results of the on-line studies demonstrate that these acceptability contrasts have an immediate impact on parsing. Reading-time results showed immediate sensitivity to the semantic congruency between an NP and a preceding pronoun in noncanonical (‘‘scrambled") word orders, and no immediate effect of semantic congruency otherwise. This contrast was found both for coreference relations involving the personal pronouns kare/kanojo (experiment 1) and for operator-variable relations involving the demonstrative pronoun soko (experiment 3). These findings go beyond previous evidence for incremental parsing in head-final languages by showing that Japanese speakers build compositional structures (such as anaphoric relations) in a grammatically constrained fashion in advance of encountering a verb in the input.},

In Optimality Theory, two types of solutions have been porposed: morphologically specialized phonological constraints (interface constraints) and different constraint rankings for different morphological categories (cophonologies). This paper presents empirical evidence that distinguishes between these two hypthoeses. Stem-final vowel alternations in Finnish are governed by a mixed set of conditions that range from purely phonological to morphological and lexical, from iron-clad exceptionless regularities to quantitative tendencies. Using a standard distionary as the data base, we show that phonolgical conditioning plays the dominant role, but in cases where phonology underdetermines the output, morphological conditioning may emerge. We then show that partial ordering of constraints, commonly used to model variation, extends to morphological conditioning as well. The partial ordering model is a restrictive version of the cphonology model, which is thus supported.},

This paper examines two phonological processes that simultaneously exhibit both phenomena: Assibilation and Apocope in Finnish. The evidence converges on two main conclusions. First, variation results from the presence of MULTIPLE METRICAL SYSTEMS within Finnish. Assibilation and Apocope are metrically conditioned alternations and the segmental variation reflects metrical variation. The metrical analysis explains a number of apparently unrelated phenomena, including typological asymmetries across dialects, quantitative asymmetries within dialects, differences between nouns and verbs, differences among noun classes, and the loci of lexical frequency effects. Second, phonological opacity arises from MORPHOLOGICAL LEVEL ORDERING. By interleaving transparent phonologies with independently motivated morphosyntactic constituents (stems, words, phrases) we derive the transparent and opaque interactions of four phonological processes, including Assibilation and Apocope.},

We propose an approach to gradient phonotactics based on Optimality Theory (Prince and Smolensky 1993/2004). At the heart of the proposal is the Complexity Hypothesis that attributes the relative well-formedness of a lexical item to its relative grammatical complexity measured in terms of ranking information: the more complex the lexical item, the less well-formed it is. The theory orders linguistic structures in an implicational hierarchy that reflects their relative well-formedness. Some implications are universal; others depend on language-specific rankings. The Complexity Hypothesis is supported by phonotactic data from Muna (Austronesian) as recently analyzed by Coetzee and Pater (2008).},

  abstract = {The object of inquiry in linguistics is the human ability to acquire and use a natural language, and the goal of linguistic theory is an explicit characterization of that ability. Looking at the communicative abilities of other species, it becomes clear that our linguistic ability is specific to our species, undoubtedly a product of our biology. But how do we go about determining the specifics of this Language faculty? There are two primary ways in which we infer the nature of Language from the properties of individual languages: arguments from the POVERTY OF THE STIMULUS, and the search for universals that characterize every natural language. Arguments of the first sort are not easy to construct (though not as difficult as sometimes suggested), and apply only to a tiny part of Language as a whole. Arguments from universals or typological generalizations are also quite problematic. In phonology, morphology, and syntax, factors of historical development, functional underpinnings, and limitations of the learning situation, among others, conspire to compromise the explanatory value of arguments from observed crosslinguistic regularities. Confounding the situation is the likelihood that properties found across languages as a consequence of such external forces have been incorporated into the Language faculty evolutionarily through the BALDWIN EFFECT. The conflict between the biologically based specificity of the human Language faculty and the difficulty of establishing most of its properties in a secure way cannot, however, be avoided by ignoring or denying the reality of either of its poles.},

It also focuses on a few Indo-European languages (French, Greek, and particularly English), but refers to a wider range of language types. While not an exhaustive account of hte variations in name syntax and morphology, significant variation is nevertheless encountered and analyzed. The suggested universal aspects have some plausibility. I propose that names belong universally, with pronouns and determiners, to a category of determinative. The behavior of names as vocatives and in predications of nomination suggests that they are, unlike pronouns and determiners, inherenlty neither defintie nor indefinite. Moreover, in such circumstances names do not function as regular arguments of the predicator; they do not bear a specified semantic relation to the predicator: they are either extrasentential or appositive. In order to figure as arguments in other types of predication, and be assigned a specified semantic relation, names must acquire definiteness. languages differ in whether definiteness is signaled overtly or not: in English, for instance, definite names are not distinguished in form from nondefinite, whereas in greek definite use of a name is marked by an accompanying article.

The first half of the paper ($\backslash$S$\backslash$S1\textendash{}3) looks at syllable structure with a view to determining what aspects of syllable structure are contrastive, so basic. It is concluded that, particularly given the need to satisfy sonority, linearity within the syllable is minimally- or non-contrastive, but that the head-based structural relations of complementation and adjunction may be contrastive. $\backslash$S4 argues indeed that phonological (and specifically syllabic) structure displays the same distinctions among complement, adjunct and specifier that is evident in the syntax, and indicates that this analogy is not an isolated case by pointing to a further one involving harmony, a familiar notion from the phonology that can be applied to syntactic phenomena such as sequence of tenses . The paper concludes ($\backslash$S5) with a brief survey of factors limiting structural analogy. These all have to do with the demands of the interfaces of the linguistic with the extra-linguistic: on the one hand, the need for the syntax to represent complex cognitively-based scenes; on the other, the restrictions imposed by the phoneticity of phonology, particularly the requirements of sonority discussed initially.},

Evidence for this claim comes from the intuitions of L1 English-speaking classroom learners of French with respect to two properties of the French nominal system, both of which are posited to be the surface manifestations of a single parametric option for noun movement within a D(eterminer) P(hrase). These include (i) the distinction between result and process nominals in the licensing of postnominal genitives and (ii) the distinction between prenominal and postnominal adjective position in the context of unique versus nonunique noun referents. An analysis of the results of an acceptability judgment task administered to 100 university-level learners, 27 native French speakers, and 30 native English-speaker controls demonstrated that particular interpretive asymmetries associated with these properties, although underdetermined in the input and not syntactically instantiated in English, nonetheless appeared in the interlanguage grammars of the study participants. Moreover, changes in learner response patterns by level were highly suggestive of a developmental path involving an initial English-like parse of the test sentences followed by a parametric shift at the 3rd-year level, leading to increasingly more native-like intuitions at later levels wherein both properties cluster together. Such results call into question the need for theories of L2 acquisition positing selective transfer, selective impairment, or both at the level of syntactic representation.},

I show that these properties lead to a new generalization that can be derived from independent assumptions about the syntax-phonology interface, according to which an intonational phrase whose boundary cannot be properly demarcated is disallowed in PF. I argue that this is exactly why null complementizer clauses are ruled out in certain syntactic positions.

The theory of object asymmetries (Baker, 1988a; Bresnan and Moshi, 1990) makes the fundamental claim that passive types are just one of the possible manifestations of an underlying asymmetry among objects. I argue that facts that might be taken as evidence against this claim turn out to have an analysis that is consistent with it and thus preserves important predictions made by the theory of object asymmetries. The analysis of these and other facts that reveal asymmetries among objects supports the assumption that the theory of object asymmetries relies heavily on a level of representation in which arguments are ranked by prominence, as determined by their thematic roles. The conclusion that an adequate theory must view the type of passive not as a property of the passive morpheme (contra Woolford, 1993), but as a manifestation of an underlying feature of the language, argues against the view that requries parameters to be morpheme-based: at least in some cases, paramters must be language-based.},

I show that this restriction follows straightforwardly if, following Koster (1978), sentential subjects are analyzed as topic phrases linked to a phonetically null DP in Spec,IP. I further suggest that this DP is an argument (not an expletive) and that it eventually undergoes A'-movement, making sentential subject constructions a species of the null operator constructions discussed in Chomsky 1977. The analysis is supported by (i) active/ passive asymmetries involving sentential subjects, (ii) agreement phenomena, (iii) restrictions on A'-movement across sentential subjects, (iv) parallels between sentential subject and CP-topicalization constructions, and (v) the distribution of embedded sentential subjects. The analysis also correctly predicts certain facts concerning the co-occurrence of seem and sentential subjects in raising constructions. An interesting consequence of the analysis is that some form of idiosyncratic selection for DP complementation must be available within the lexicon, contrary to what has been suggested elsewhere.},

  abstract = {The exclusive component of unembedded disjunctions is standardly derived as a conversational implicature by assuming that or forms a lexical scale with and. It is well known, however, that this assumption does not suffice to determine the required scalar competitors of disjunctions with more than two atomic disjuncts (McCawley, Everything that linguists have always wanted to know about logic* (But were ashamed to ask). Chicago University Press, Chicago, 1993, p. 324; Simons, ``Or'': Issues in the semantics and pragmatics of disjunction. Ph.D. thesis, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, 1998). To solve this, Sauerland (Linguist Philos 27(3): 367\textendash{}391, 2004) assumes that or forms a lexical scale with two otherwise unattested silent connectives (L and R) that retrieve the left and right terms of a disjunction. A number of recent works have pro- posed an Alternative Semantics for indefinites and disjunction to account for their interaction with modals and other propositional operators (Kratzer and Shimoyama, In: Otsu Y (ed) The Proceedings of the Third Tokyo Confer- ence on Psycholinguistics. Hituzi Syobo, Tokyo, pp. 1\textendash{}25, 2002; Aloni, In: Weisgerber M (ed) Proceedings of the Conference ``SuB7\textemdash{}Sinn und Bedeutung''. Arbeitspapier Nr. 114.

Ph.D. thesis, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA, 2006). We note that the McCawley\textendash{}Simons problem does not arise in an Alternative Semantics, if we assume that the set of pragmatic competitors to a disjunction is the closure under intersection of the set of propositions that it denotes. An adaptation of the strengthening mechanism presented in Fox (In: Sauerland U, Stateva P (eds) Presupposition and implicature in compositional semantics. MacMillan, Palgrave, pp. 71\textendash{}120, 2007) allows for the derivation of the exclusive compo- nent of disjunctions with more than two atomic disjuncts without having to rely on the L and R operators. The proposal extends to the case of disjunctions with logically dependent disjuncts.},

  abstract = {We present an experimental investigation of the role of resumptive pronouns. We investigate object extraction in WH-questions for a range of syntactic configurations (nonislands, weak islands, strong islands) and for multiple levels of embedding (single, double, and triple). In order to establish the crosslinguistic properties of resumption, parallel experiments were conducted in three languages, viz. English, Greek, and German. Three main experimental results are reported. First, resumption does not remedy island violations: resumptive pronominals are at most as acceptable as gaps, but not more acceptable. This result disconfirms claims in the literature that resumptives can `save' island violations. Second, embedding reduces acceptability even in extraction out of nonislands and declaratives, structures standardly assumed to be fully grammatical. Third, nonislands and weak islands pattern together and contrast with strong islands in terms of the effect of resumption and embedding. Our experimental findings show a remarkable consistency across the three languages we investigate; crosslinguistic variation appears confined to quantitative differences in crosslinguistically identical principles. We argue that these experimental results can be explained by the interaction of grammatical principles with resource limitations of the human parser. In particular, extraction from nonislands and weak islands imposes increased demands on the computational resources of the parser. We extend Gibson's (1998) syntactic prediction locality theory in order to formalize this intuition and account for the processing complexity of A-bar dependencies.},

It is argued that resumption arises on two occasions: (i) as a last resort strategy when identification of phe-features of non-arguments fails; (ii) in the absence of a syntactic feature on C trigerring Agree/Move. In the first case obligatory resumption is restricted to non-argument positions and is sensitive to islands. This is the case of Greek null operator restrictive relatives. In particular, it is argued that identification requirements are grammaticised on Greek C (pu), which is endowed with phi-features. Failure of Agree of the phi-features of pu leads to resumption in non-argument positions. In quiestions and operator restrictive relatives identification reqruirements are straightforwardly satisfied by the presence of an overt operator; resumption therefore is never obligatory in these structures. In the secon case, where resumption is the consequence of absence of a sytactic relation (agree/move) between C and the relativeised site, resumption is obligatory in argument and non-argument positions (modulo the highest subject restriction) and insensitive to islands. Greek non-restrictive relatives and Semit restrictive relatives exemplfy this case.},

  abstract = {The paper investigates a number of asymmetries in the behavior of subjects in Germanic, Celtic/Arabic, Romance, and Greek. The langauges under investigation divide into two main groups with respect to a cluster of properties, including the availability of pro-drop with referential subjects, the possibility of VSO/VOS orders, the A/A' status of subjects in SVO orders, the presence/absence of Definiteness Restriction (DR)-effects in unaccusative constructions, the existence of verb-raising independently of V-2, and others. We argue that the key factor in this split is a parametrization in the way the Extended Projection Principle (EPP) is checked: move/merge XP vs. move/merge Xo. The fist option is taken in Germanic, the second in Celtic, Greek, and Romance. According to our proposal, the EPP relates to checking of a nominal feature of AGR (cf. Chomsky 1995), and move/merge Xo languages satsify the EPP via V-raising, as their verbal agreement morphology includes the requisite nominal feature (cf. Taraldsen 1978). Moreover, we demonstrate that the further differences that exist between Celtic/Arabic on the one hand and Romance/Greek on the other are related to the parametric availability of Spec, TP for subjects (cf. Jonas and Bobljik 1993, Bobaljik and Jonas 1996). In Celtic and Arabic, Spec, TP for subjects is licensed, resulting in VSO orders with VP external subjects. IN Greek and Romance, Spec, TP is not licensed, resulting in 'subject inverted' orders with VP internal subjects. In other words, we show that within the class of move/merge Xo languages, a further partition emerges which is due to the same parameter divding Germanic langauges into two major classes. We demonstrate that combining the proposed EPP/AGR parameter with the Spec, TP parameter gives four language-types with distinct properties.},

The empirical domain consists of constructions where subject movement is not required for reasons that have to do with the Extended Projection Principle. In these environments and whenever a sentence contains both a subject and a direct object, one of the arguments must vacate the VP. We argue that argument externalization is related to Case. It is forced because movement of both arguments to a single head To that contains two active Case features in the covert componenet is banned.},

Its interpretation highlights the contrast between different views of the status of morphology.

For others, morphological structure is autonomous, and syncretism provides direct evidence of this. In this article, I discuss two phenomena that argue for the second view. Directional Effects and Unnatural Classes of values resist attempts to reduce them to epiphenomena of more gneeral rule types and require purely morphological devices for their expression.},

In this paper, we contribute to the ongoing discussion by looking at verb order variation in 3- and 4-verb clusters in German on the basis of new empirical evidence. First, we present several experiments that have used the method of speeded grammaticality judgments in order to determine the orders within a verb cluster that are accepted by native speakers. A major result of our experiments is that native speakers accept more orders than are allowed in Standard German. Second, we give a theoretical account of the data which applies and extends Williams' (2003) CAT-language. We show how the variation between Standard German and the more liberal Colloquial German that was revealed in our experiments follows from slightly different lexical entries within this system. Standard German is characterized by a complexity requirement on modal verb complements that restricts verb order variation. The more liberal Colloquial German system lacks this feature and thus allows a larger variation of verb orders.},

We show that this greater semantic density for irregulars is reflected in association norms, familiarity ratings, visual lexical-decision latencies, and word-naming latencies. Meta-analyses of the materials of two neuroimaging studies show that in these studies, regularity is confounded with differences in semantic density. Our results challenge the hypothesis of the supposed formal encapsulation of rules of inflection and support lines of research in which sensitivity to probability is recognized as intrinsic to human language.},

Starting from a full range of comparative studies showing the presence of a delay in the acquisition of the interpretive properties of non-reflexive pronominals and the absence of such a delay in languages where clitic pronominals are involved, we argue that this range of effects is elegantly derived from a general constraint on extra-lexical operations of valency-reduction, turning relations into one-place predicates. This analysis leads to a sort of cross-modular (re)interpretation of Principle B of Binding Theory and to a radically new analysis of the relation between (semantic) binding and coreference. Another important consequence of the proposed analysis is that it supports the view of Romance clitics as morphosyntactically encoding a lexical operation of reflexivization. In the second part of this article, we show that this analysis explains some intriguing and so far poorly understood asymmetries between reflexive and non-reflexive clitics arising within the domain of complex predicate constructions in Romance.},

  abstract = {This paper argues for a distinction between word formation from roots and word formation from existing words. Focusing on Hebrew, it is shown that roots \textendash{} and only roots \textendash{} may be assigned multiple interpretations in different environments. When the basis for the derivation is a word, this word forces its semantic and phonological properties on any element derived from it. To account for this difference, a locality constraint on the interpretation of roots is postulated: the first nominal or verbal head that merges with the root serves as the immediate environment for determining its interpretation. This head forms a closed domain: any further derivation takes as its input not the root iteslf, but an element whose semantic and phonological properties have been cased out. Word-derived words thus have access only to thewords they are derived from, not to the root. While the ability of hebrew roots to acquire multiple interpretations is language specific, the distinction between word fromation from roots and word formation from words is shown to be universal. This is illustrated here with English zero-related pairs, which are shown to ehibit the same contrasts as Hebrew bewteen word formation from roots and from words. Showing the effect of roots in word formation in both Hebrew and English further motivates the root hypothesis, namely, that in all languages the lexical kernel, or the root, is distinct from 'words' \textendash{} complex entities \textendash{} even if this distinction is not always morphologically manifested.},

Most of the previous explanations of the phenomenon stipulated that the anaphoric nature of subjunctive Tense leads to an extension of the binding domain of the subject pronoun to include the matrix clause, thus leading to the pronoun being locally bound in violation of Principle B. Using evidence from Russian, we show that the domain extension approaches cannot be correct. We argue for an analysis in which the subjunctive Complementizer is an operator which moves at LF to bind the events of the matrix and the subjunctive cluases. The resulting configuration creates a violation of Principle B with respect to the subjunctive AgrS which is coindexed with the subjunctive subject. Our approach can explain all of the known facts and makes strong cross-linguistic predictions that we show to be correct.},

An analysis of these facts is proposed in terms of iterpretive strategies at LF stemming from the use languages make of typing particles in Co. This analysis has the advantage of providing adequate empirical coverage while preserving the cross-linguistic/cross-dialectal universality of Binding Theory.

I argue for a more articulated theory of the syntax-semantics interface, one which recognizes the ability of BOCs such as referential disjointness conditions to make reference to semantic information from two distinct sources, one of which uses lexically encoded material known as conventional implicature or semantic presupposition. This hypoothesis accounts for why lexical elements such as even, only, emphatic anaphors, etc. seem to allow the nominal elements which they focus to freely violate the well-known disjointness requirements known as Condition B, Condition C and Weak Crossover. It also leads to the conclusion that Condition A is not a BOC and that proposals which attempt to derive its effects from movement constraints internal to the computational system are probably on the right track.},

First, interpretive constraints which use information form the computational system take precedence over those which do not. Second, the principles of economy which regulate grammatical operations in the computational component appear to extend beyond LF. The first conclusion would seem to indicate that the idea that syntax is autonomous is on the right track. That is, at least in the case discussed, it would seem that the output of the computational system is not influenced by the cognitive systems which access its interface representations; in fact, quite the opposite. The second conclusion, on the other hand, would seem to argue for an integrated model of grammar in which each module, computational or representational, is subject to similar economy conditions and is therefore as much part of grammatical theory as the other.},

  title = {Relational {{Nouns}}, {{Pronouns}}, and {{Resumption}}},
  volume = {28},
  abstract = {This paper presents a variable-free analysis of relational nouns in Glue Semantics, within a Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG) architecture. Relational nouns and resumptive pronouns are bound using the usual binding mechanisms of LFG. Special attention is paid to the bound readings of relational nouns, how these interact with genitives and obliques, and their behaviour with respect to scope, crossover and reconstruction. I consider a puzzle that arises regarding relational nouns and resumptive pronouns, given that relational nouns can have bound readings and resumptive pronouns are just a specific instance of bound pronouns. The puzzle is: why is it impossible for bound implicit arguments of relational nouns to be resumptive? The puzzle is highlighted by a well-known variety of variable-free semantics, where pronouns and relational noun phrases are identical both in category and (base) type. I show that the puzzle also arises for an established variable-based theory. I present an analysis of resumptive pronouns that crucially treats resumptives in terms of the resource logic linear logic that underlies Glue Semantics: a resumptive pronoun is a perfectly ordinary pronoun that constitutes a surplus resource; this surplus resource requires the presence of a resumptive-licensing resource consumer, a manager resource. Manager resources properly distinguish between resumptive pronouns and bound relational nouns based on differences between them at the level of semantic structure. The resumptive puzzle is thus solved. The paper closes by considering the solution in light of the hypothesis of direct compositionality. It is argued that a directly compositional version of the theory is possible, although perhaps not desirable. The implications for direct compositionality are considered.},

In order to provide a unified treatment of focus above and below the word level (they do, after all, behave the same in most respects), I develop a theory of denotations for arbitrary word parts in which focused word parts denote their own sound and the unfocused parts are functions from sounds to word meanings. This allows focus theories to generalize below the word level; any differences with focus above the word level are located in the semantics of word parts. The paper also explores phonological constraints on focus placement, and shows that the focusability of a word part depends solely on its prosodic status, not on any semantic factors.},

Differences in the interpretation of the conditionals are derived from the interaction between the interpretation of different types of aspect and the modal. The paper makes a distinction between perfective and perfect aspect in terms of whether they make reference to or quantify over Lewis-style events. In making reference to Lewis-events, perfective aspect is shown to be incompatible with counterfactual would- conditionals. The so-called `epistemic flavor' of perfective conditionals about the future is derived from the use of diagonalization as an interpretive strategy called upon to resolve reference.},

The surface syntax of clausal pied-piping structures suggests that their syntax and semantics should be similar to scope marking constructions as analyzed in the Indirect Dependency approach. However, data having to do with presupposition projection and teh interpretation of "how many"-questions show that clausal pied-piping structures are actually more similar to their long-distance wh-movement counterparts than to scope marking constructions. I develop an analysis which takes into account these facts. Specifically, I show that pied-piped clauses must reconstruct, which makes the correct prediction that clausal pied-piping, unlike long-distance wh-movement, is sensitive to negative islands. Finally, I propose that reconstruction is forced by a condition on the interpretation of traces.},

Drawing on Spanish, Basque and English data, this article argues that these two parts of a split question are independent clauses. The tag is in fact an elliptical non-wh-question, where ellipsis is licensed in the same way as in other sentence fragments. I provide detailed argumentation that the tag involves movement of a correlate of the wh-phrase, followed by ellipsis of the remnant, thus contributing to the growing body of evidence that sentence fragments (sluicing, fragment answers, etc.) are syntactically full clauses. The syntax proposed provides a simple account of the intonation patterns found in split questions and of their semantics. Furthermore, it is argued that the only existing alternative analysis of split questions cannot account for many of the properties of this construction.},

We show that at least two pervasive types of inflectional morphology, verb agreement and classifier constructions, are iconically grounded in spatiotemporal cognition, while the sequential patterns can be traced to normal historical development. We attribute the paucity of sequential morphology in sign languages to their youth. This research both brings sign languages much closer to spoken languages in their morphological structure and shows how the medium of communication contributes to the structure of languages.},

For each language we found a pervasive restriction that is responsible for the missing cominations: german has closing suffixes, which individually prevent further suffixation. English allows only one Germanic suffix per word. In both languages the restriction holds for inflection and for clitics as well. For German, we also found that all closing suffixes are followed by linking elements in compounds, and that this constitutes the major productive use of linking elements. for English, we also found that Latinate suffixes are much more susceptible to combination, so that the Germanic and Latinate suffixes follow complementary patterns. Our findings for English show that the often-repeated observation that English inflectional morphology is simpler than that of related languages extends to derivation as well.},

The morphological templates (in CV terms, CVCC, CVVCC, and CVCVVC) do not parse directly into well-formed Yawelmani surface syllables (CV, CVV, CVC). Nonetheless, as argued here, these templates can be expressed in terms of legitimate prosodic units, thereby supporting the prosodic morphology hypothesis (McCarthy and Prince 1986, 1987, 1990). The basic idea is that segments map from left to right to the template, but if the template is too small, any leftover stem consonants simply undergo left to right syllabification. This analysis accounts for the general templatic mapping of verbs and nouns as well as the different kinds of reduplication in Yawelmani. It also provides a more explanatory account of the 'ghost' consonants\textendash{} initial consonants in some of the suffixes which surface only when the stem is biconsonantal, but not if the stem is larger. The analysis not only provides support for the prosodic morphology hypothesis, it also argues in favor of a templatic view of syllabification (Ito 1986, 1989) and a rule of Weight-by-Position (Hayes 1989) operating independently of the general syllabification process.},

  volume = {58},
  abstract = {Nominalization and verb serialization are widely attested phenomena in the generative linguistic literature, but an in-depth study of their interaction remains to be undertaken. Based on data from Dagaare, a Gur language of West Africa, this paper analyzes a type of complex predicate construction, nominalized serial verbs, in which only one of the verbs carries a nominalization affix. With this, a number of issues about the nature of complex predicatehood, syntactic alternations, and lexical categorial differences involving nouns and verbs across languages are addressed. The paper proposes that, basically, serial verb nominalizations are VPs headed by a NomP functional projection.},

  volume = {82},
  abstract = {British andAmerican speakers exhibit different verb number agreement patterns when sentence subjects have collective headnouns. From linguistic andpsycholinguistic accounts of how agreement is implemented, three alternative hypotheses can be derived to explain these differences. The hypotheses involve variations in the representation of notional number, disparities in how notional andgrammatical number are used, and inequalities in the grammatical number specifications of collective nouns. We carriedout a series of corpus analyses, production experiments, andnorming studies to test these hypotheses. The results converge to suggest that British and American speakers are equally sensitive to variations in notional number andimplement subjectverb agreement in much the same way, but are likely to differ in the lexical specifications of number for collectives. The findings support a psycholinguistic theory that explains verb and pronoun agreement within a parallel architecture of lexical andsyntactic formulation.},

We question here certain (largely tacit) key assumptions of their analysis, including the appropriateness of their morphological gloss, the c-command relations that drive the analysis, and the degree to which honorification is similar to the agreement configurations in the other languages they consider. We suggest that various omissions in their article have led them to posit a greater degree of similarity than the data actually show, and we conclude that an assimilation of honorification to object agreement along the lines Boeckx and Niinuma propose is a much more ambitious task than their article suggests; in part, this is precisely because OH does not look like (object) agreement by any of the criteria that they consider.},

The account we are led to suggests that locality domains are not absolute but are relativized in two ways: firstly, Agree and A-movement respect different (if overlapping) locality conditions, and secondly, whether or not a given projection constitutes a domain boundary depends partly on its syntactic context. At the core of the paper is the proposed generalization that A-movement is forced, and cannot reconstruct, exactly when a DP originates in a lower agreement domain than its licensor.},

In this article we propose a new analysis of scrambling that puts scrambling in conformity with the Last Resort principle. We argue that scrambled elements are base-generated in their surface non-theta-positions and undergo obligatory LF movement to the position where they receive theta-roles, which we consider to be formal features capable of driving movement. We show that our LF analysis of scrambling is both conceptually and empirically superior to the standard optional movement analysis.},

MWFL differ from English, Chinese, and French in that in MWFL even wh-phrases that do not undergo wh-movement still must front for an independent reason, argued to involve focus.

The generalization is shown to follow from an interaction of independently motivated assumptions concerning the structure of floating quantifier constructions and the mechanism of adjunction. The analysis of quantifier float proposed in the paper is shown to have important consequences for a number of issues and phenomena, including clausal structure, PP structure, object shift, cliticization, V-movement, Case licensing, small clauses, scope reconstruction, pied-piping, and heavy NP shift. Regarding PP structure, the paper pursues the clause/PP parallelism hyptothesis: it is shown that there is a clause/PP parallelims with respect to Case-licensing, V/P movement, cliticization, and object shift.},

The fact that the rescue-by-PF-deletion analysis makes it possible to unify a number of previously unrelated phe- nomena should be taken as a strong argument in its favor. The current extension of the rescue-by-PF-deletion approach, on which the rescue can arise not only through the deletion process involved in ellipsis but also through regular copy deletion, also accounts for the different behavior of the Superiority Condition and the Wh-Island Condition with respect to the amelioration effect under ellipsis, a surprising difference given that both of these are generally subsumed under relativized minimality effects in current research.},

I present experimental and naturalistic data confirming the claim that Dutch root infinitives are more often modal than English root infinitives. This cross-linguistic difference is significatly smaller than previously assumed, however. Explaining the observations, I assume that morphology operates separately from syntax and semantics (Beard (1982; 1995)) and rely on teh notion of underspecification (Halle and Marantz (1993), Harley and Noyer (1999)). It is argued that the Dutch infinitival verb and the English bare verb are both underspecified vocabulary items that can be inserted in various syntactic contexts. Syntactic difference between Dutch and English result in the includion of tensed root infinitives in English, whereas Dutch root infinitives are limited to untensed clauses. This proposal accounts for cross-linguistic differences in the meaning of root infinitives, cross-linguistic differences in type of verbal predicate, variability in the meaning of root infinitives, and patterns in subject selection.},

The analyses distinguish morphomic stems, which underlie morphosyntactically distinct word forms, from inflectional stems, which realize tense and mood features and provide the input to regular agreement rules. It is argued that the recognition of these stem types simplifies the description of West Germanic conjugations, supports a general realization-based approach, and suggests a reinterpretation of current realizational models.},

Within Optimality Theory, this restriction is explained by aLocal Conjunction that controls vowel deletion as well as the alignment between the main foot and the head of the lexical word, which is irrelevant for the evaluation of outputs containing a diphthong, and therefore allows, in the latter case, the unmarked structure to emerge.},

Rather, the properties that these constructions share with th-clefts can be straightforwardly accounted for as the sum of the constraints on their shared elements\textemdash{}that is, the equative construction, the demonstrative subject, and the presence of a contextually salient open proposition. The convergence of these elemental properties in each of these three constructions results in the possibility of the demonstrative being used to refer to the instantiation of the variable in the open proposition, which in turn predicts a complex of distributional behaviors shared by precisely the constructions that share these properties. Because these distributional behaviors can be straightforwardly explained in terms of this functional compositionality, the motivation for a truncated-cleft analysis disappears. These results support the view that not all functional properties must be learned on a construction-by-construction basis; instead, the discourse functions of an utterance are built up compositionally from those of its parts.},

In the diachronic domain, we briefly take issue with the feasibility of constraint reranking as an explanation for change, and then turn to a consideration of how a reinterpre- tation of Roberts and Roussou's (2003) analysis of ``increasing negativity'' may be captured in terms of an Agree-based system (cf. Biberauer and Roberts 2010b).

  volume = {21},
  abstract = {Correlativization seems to be an intrinsically non-local strategy, where the Correlative clause can appear discontinuous from the noun phrase it modifies. I show that correlative constructions in the Modem Indo-Aryan languages nevertheless display locality effects. The nature of these locality effects depends upon whether the correlative clause involves a single relativization ('Simple') or mutiple relativizations ('Multi-Head'). The generalization that emerges is that a Correlative clause must be merged as locally as possible to the phrase that it modifies. Simple correlatives modify DPs and so they start adjoined to the DP that they modify and then are fronted to an IP-adjoined position. Such an approach is able to explain the hitherto unexplained sensitivity of the correlative-modified phrase relationship to islands. Multi-Head Correlatives modify IPs and therefore they start adjoined to the smallest IP that contains the variables bound by the Multi-Head Correlative, followed by optional movement to the clause-initial position. My proposal argues that Simple Correlatives and Multi-Head Correlatives involve different derivational histories. This difference in derivational history is then used to account for the many differences in their syntactic behavior. Finally, the 'Condition on Local Merge' from which this analysis follows is shown to have cross-linguistic support},

This article provides an analysis of true truncation in colloquial Hebrew imperatives. It is shown that true truncation cannot target a designated phonological unit, since in some forms CV is truncated and in others only V. In addition, there are cases where truncation is blocked. The framework of optimality theory adopted here allows a unified account of the data in terms of constraint interaction. It is argued that an antifaithfulness truncation constraint, which must be morphological, interacts with both faithfulness and markedness constraints. Truncation is minimized to one segment by a general antideletion faithfulness constraint, but markedness constraints may impose truncation of more than one segment. There are cases where truncation is blocked, which suggests that the truncation constraint is violable. The discussion includes regular and irregular verbs and instances of free variation.},

The differences between verbal and adjectival SCs then follow. Finally, the article compares raisign verbs with adjectival SC complements and raising vrbs with infinitival complemetns, showing again that hte differences in the syntax and semantics of such constructions are related to whether or not the subject of the embedded clause must be a topic.},

The analysis is situated within the Distributed Morphology framework. It argues for the presence of a small clause structure only in the particle verb construction and not in the benefactive construction; the particle merges directly with the Root while the benefactive possessive element merges with an already categorized verb. The benefactive differs from the better researched dative in that the dative does involve a caused possession small clause structure. Particle verbs can occur in double object constructions, but they involve a benefactive-like syntax and not a caused possession small clause analysis. Furthermore, I argue that the Roots that underlie these verbs are relationless and underspecified with respect to meaning, supporting the idea that the functional vocabulary introduces arguments and fully specifies the meaning of the Roots. However, rather than adopting the position that an object is introduced at only one point in the derivation, this analysis shows that an object can be introduced at several different points within the derivation. Finally, this paper shows that argument merger is sensitive to the phase structure of the clause.},

In particular, this paper demonstrates that disparities between phonetic characteristics of tones and their phonological activity can be understood as a kind of underspecification that the Contrastive Hierarchy affords. The second goal of this paper is to propose an analysis in which contour tones in Chinese languages generally are represented as unitary entities rather than as a concatenation of level tones (Tone Clusters). This contrasts with the tonal systems found in African languages, in which contour tones are demonstrably composed of level tones. Thus, this paper argues for the existence of two types of contour tones in natural language: unitary contour tones and Tone Clusters.},

I argue that an independently needed refinement of the semantic analyses of the partitive of Ladusaw (1982) and Hoeksema (1984) automatically predicts these anti-uniqueness facts. More specifically, I propose that partivitiy is always propoer partivity. This will guarantee that any property denoted by a partitive will have at least two entities in its extension, and cannot uniquely identify an individual; thus partitives are anti-unique. In addition, this paper makes a new case for analyzing double genitives as partitives. A number of syntactic and semantic arguments will show that, despite appearances, so-called double genitives (a friend of John's) have less in common with a superficially quite similar type of simple genitive (a friend of John) than with standard partitives (one of John's friends). If double genitives are indeed a type of partitive, this explains why they also exhibit anti-uniqueness effects: *I met [the friend of John's] is bad but I met the [[ friend of John's] that he traveled with from Mexico] is perfect fine.},

Continuations are a well-established analytic tool int eh theory of programming language semantics; in brief, a continuation is the entire default future of a computation. I show how a continuation-based grammar can unify several aspects of natural language quantification in a new way: merely stating the truth conditions for quantificational expressions in terms of continuations automatically accounts for scope displacement and scope ambiguity. To prove this claim, I exhibit a simple finite context-free grammar with a strictly compositional semantics in which quantificational NPs are interpeted in situ but take semantic scope over larger constituents. There is not Quantifier Raising (nor any use of a lvel of Logical Form distinct from overt syntax), no Cooper Storage (re similar mechanisms used in many recnt HPSG, Categorial, or type-logical treatments), and no need for type shifting (as in Hendriks' Flexible Types account). continuations also provide a natural account of generalized coordination that does not require either type-shifting or type polymorphism. Compositionality issues are discussed in some detail.},

  abstract = {This paper argues that Principle A is not 'an anywhere principle', contrary to Belletti and Rizzi (1988) and much subsequent work, but must apply relatively late in derivations, perhaps at the end of each phase (Chomsky 2000). Evidence comes principally from the analysis of pseudo-gapping, in which the ellipsis remnant is extracted to a position outside of the VP which deletes. Anaphors cannot appear as ellipsis remnants when the antecedent is within the deleted material. The interaction of anaphora and ellipsis is mirrored by restrictions on scrambling of anaphors in Dutch object scramblign and a unified analysis is proposed. The paper draws implications for other theories of constituency, such as Phillips (1996), as well as for the A-status of the ellipsis remnant, $\backslash$emphcontra Jayaseelan (1999). Given that the ellipsis remnant is focused, focus cannot be explicitly represented in syntactic representations, but rather must be interpretive in nature.},

The evidence for the nonconstituency of the verb and its original arguments inpreposed position comes from its solution to what has been termed Pesetsky's paradox, in that an object of a preposed VP can bind into an adverbial at the end of a sentence, creating an apparent conflict between the assumptions that binding requires c-command and that only constituents move. This article also provides evidence for c-command as the prominence constraint on binding, rather than o-command (Pollard \& Sag 1994) or f-command (Dalrymple 1999).*},

The latter create verb phrases that contain more than one propositional level whereas the former do not permit any propositional levels within their derived verb phrases. Evidence for this distinction comes from the interaction of again with the different types of verbs. Non-stative, transitive verbs allow again to introduce presuppositions that do not involve the verb's subject. In contrast intransitive verbs and stative, transitive verbs only permit presuppositions that include the verb's subject. Not only does the evidence of propositional complexity and the existence of subjectless presuppositions demonstrate a dichotomy between different types of verb phrases, such evidence and presuppositions also provide a means of testing in which syntactic positions quantifier phrases can be interpreted. As I demonstrate in this article, evidence from the presuppositional content of again suggests that object quantifier phrases normally cannot be interpreted within the verb phrase even when such phrases contain propositional levels. Only resultative verbs allow for quantifier phrases to be interpreted within the verb phrase.},

We claim that these two ways of assigning case are complementary, based on data from the Turkic language Sakha. Accusative case and dative case in this language are assigned by Marantz-style configurational rules that do not refer directly to functional categories. This is shown by evidence from passives, agentive nominalizations, subject raising, possessor raising, and case assignment in PPs. In contrast, there is evidence that nominative and genitive are as- signed by functional heads in the Chomskyan way, as shown by the distribution of nominative case and the relationship between case marking and agreement. The two methods of case assignment thus coexist, not only in Universal Grammar, but even in the grammar of a single language.},

We compare the syntax of this linker particle in Kinande (Niger-Congo) to its syntax in two Khoisan languages, Ju|'hoansi and 4Hoan. We propose an account of the properties that linkers in these languages share, including the linkers' word order properties and Case-theoretic contributions. We then go on to explore the range of variation that the linker construction tolerates, with respect to what phrases can move into the linker's specifier, and whether or not the linker manifests agreement with its specifier. In so doing, we uncover both the principles and the parameters relevant to these linker constructions. Finally, we point to some evidence that the linker category even exists in Chichewa (and other Bantu languages) in which it is not spelled out overtly. Our analysis provides striking support for the existence of vPinternal functional projections. The data in this paper also lead us to the surprising conclusion that the Minimal Link Condition can be parameterized.},

These differences can be explained by saying that the trace of NI retains its person, number, and gender features in Mohawk but not in Mapudungun. Those aspects of grammar that do not involve these features treat NI in the two languages the same; thus, NI has the same gross distribution and anaphoric possibilities in both languages. We extend these results to Nahuatl, Chukchee, Ainu, Southern Tiwa, Mayali, and Wichita, showing that our theory accounts for Mithun's (1984) distinction between Type III and Type IV noun incorporation in a general way.},

In particular, the so-called future marker is an indefinite morpheme, indicating that the event argument of the verb undergoes Heim's (1982) rule of Quantifier Indexing. In contrast, the seeming past marker is a marker of definiteness/specificity, indicating that the event argument is immune to Quantifier Indexing. This explains many apparent peculiarities of the Mohawk verbal system, including: the use of "future" as a past habitual form, the use of mood prefixes in conditionals, free relatives, and complement clauses, and the incompatibility of "past" with negation. The relationship between indefinite mood and future events, where it exists, is explicated in terms of the branching theory of time proposed by Dowty (1979) and Kamp and Reyle (1993), which is grounded in a fundamental asymmetry in how humans conceive of the future versus the past.},

I exemplify IP-Inversion using a range of constructions from Russian, and show that the "inverted" constituent has subject (A) properties, and that it is accompanied by verb-raising, which is required in such instances by the Overt Tense Condition. The ability to fill SpecIP with a non-Nominative constituent is a parameterized property of a language related to the strength of the Nominative case features in I. The driving force behind Inversion is (a version of) the (traditional) Extended Projection Principle (EPP), that is an overtness requirement on the specifier of the functional category I. Finally I argue that Inversion, as an overtness requirement on the specifier of a functional projection, can be generalized to the CP level as well, where an equivalent overtness requirement forces filling of SpecCP, as in Germanic V2 languages. The analysis allows us to unite various apparently disparate constructions as the result of a simple set of parameters, and to expose central issues of economy within the computational system.},

  volume = {13},
  abstract = {This article examines constructions involving DP-final demonstratives, possessive adjectives, indefinite quantifiers, and demonstrative reinforcers in several Romance languages. Across these languages the DP-final position of these elements yields a focus interpretation, whereas the prenominal position yields a neutral interpretation. Other approaches to these sorts of facts have (tacitly) treated the two available word orders as equivalent constructions. They have not considered, and so cannot easily account for, the distinct interpretation that each of the word orders yields. Under the assumption that the prenominal position of these elements is basic, the current approach develops the idea that the DP-final element is ``stranded'' DP finally as a result of the leftward movement of a syntactic phrase consisting of an extended NP. The facts examined here recall those characterizing the expression of focus in the Romance clause, recently analyzed as a case of scrambling (Ord\'o\~nez 1997, Zubizarreta 1998). If on the right track, the current analysis therefore provides further evidence for the parallelism between noun phrases and clauses. In certain Romance languages, an intermediate (postnominal) position is also available for these DP elements , although the interpretation associated with this position does not exactly match that of either the prenominal or DP-final position. It is proposed that the intermediate position is derived by crossing the noun over the demonstrative (reinforcer), possessive, or indefinite quantifier, whose base positions within DP are relatively high. The prediction then is that only those languages with robust noun movement (that is, movement to a relatively high functional head) will exhibit this word order.},

These effects could not be explained as the result of semantic or phonological priming, either alone or in combination. The results support a view of the lexicon in which shared form and meanign across words is a key factor in their relatedness, and in which morphological composition is not required for internal word structure to play a role in langauge processing.},

IN one of hte analyses, postverbal subjects are derived by movement, while in the other, they are base-generated in situ. According to a prominent hypothesis which attempts to explain the pattern of sparing and loss in agrammatism in terms of current linguistic theory, the only syntactic deficit is the loss of trace. This movement-derived 'trace-deletion' hypothesis has been successful in predicting what agrammatics can and cannot comprehend. In the present study, these predictions are first of all confirmed for Spanish-speaking agrammatics on a range of structures for which predictions are identical under both movement and non-movement analyses. These structures serve as a control, establishing that the claims of the trace-deletion hypothesis are valid. They pave the way for the critical test of the VS passive, the only structure for which the competing analyses yield different predictions. Agrammatic data on the VS passive are used to adjudicate between the competing analyses. Since agrammatic subjects perform randomly on VS passives, it is concluded that the postverbal subject is derived by movement.},

As our description illustrates, the set of contexts where "do"-support applies in this language is a proper subset of the English contexts. The syntax of fa-support in a language with typical Romance features allows us to draw some general conclusions regarding the analysis of English do-support and the interfaces between syntax and morphology, on one side, and syntax and lexical-semantic structure, on the other. First we will show how fa-support in this Romance langauge constitutes evidence in favor of the hypothesis that V to C movement applies also in Romance main questions. Second, some aspects of Rizzi's (1991) proposal that subject sh-sentences have a CP structure with the wh- in SpecC is confirmed by the presence of an overt complementizer in the language we are dealing with. Thirdly, the phenomenon of Romance fa-support will lead us to further develop Pollock's idea that do-insertion is directly connected with the theta-grid of a verb: a main verb cannot move to a thematically opaque position, while auxiliaries can, as they do not have a theta-grid. In the Romance dialect we analyze some verbs move to C (or use do-support) independently of their use as auxiliaries or as main verbs. In order to account for this aspect of the phenomenon, we suggest a more detailed description of the process.},

For ASL classifeirs, we claim that there are two basic syntactic types: those that are associated with the internal argument and those that are associated with an external agentive argument. We claim that classifiers project syntactically as (functional) heads and that they determine the status (as external or internal) of the argument that lands in their Spec. We identify a discrete agentive morpheme in ASL classifier constructions, on phonological and syntactic grounds, a morpheme with is responsible for the agentive readings in two types of classifers. The phonological representaiton needed to express this morpheme expands the range of possibilities of templates used in prosodic morphology. This paper contributes to general linguistic theory in providing support for a (morpho-)syntactic analysis of argument structure alternations and in demonstrating how morphological templates can be used to account for the relation between morphological and phonological form in ASL classifiers.},

  abstract = {This article reports the results of experiments targeting the production and interpretation of postverbal subjects, and null and overt pronominal subjects, by near-native speakers of Italian whose native language is English. The results directly bear on both theoretical issues and developmental acquisition questions. It is argued that properties related to the null-subject parameter are sensitive to discourse factors that determine the use of both postverbal subjects and pronominal subjects. More specifically, it is claimed that the availability of null pronominal subjects and the availability of postverbal subjects do not necessarily correlate. The near-native grammars analyzed here illustrate a special instance of this lack of correlation. Furthermore, near-natives show non-native-like behavior in the use of postverbal subjects, and in the overuse of overt pronominal subjects in tensed clauses. The proposal is put forward that, although resetting of the null-subject parameter has taken place in the speakers' L2 Italian grammar, the relevant L1 computations are preserved and accessed in L2 use, without violating any formal conditions; this is the source of non-target behavior. The analysis proposed exploits cartographic insights on discourse-related computations, and suggests that the principles of economy may be instantiated differently in native and near-native grammars.},

A further kind of structure implementing doubling is identified in Italian, involving strong pronouns. It is claimed that doubling characteristically exploits the clause internal VP periphery (Belletti 2001, 2004) and is thus typically associated with particular discourse related interpretations and constraints. It is also claimed that doubling can be assumed to be at work in more structures than meet the eye; its role is particularly investigated in the crucial domains of subject inversion and nominative Case assignment. Finally, the status of doubling structures is addressed with respect to economy considerations; some speculative remarks concerning the comparative side of the analysis are briefly sketched out.},

In general, Case theory excludes the option of a chain receiving more than one Case. However, certain constructions arguably demonstrate that this is possible. We present a range of MCC phenomena, showing that they are incompatible with early insertion models. Inherent Case examples, such as in Icelandic, are accounted for by markedness. For structural Case examples we present an analysis in which both Case assignment and Case checking are utilized. We account for aspects of English, Norwegian, and Niuean MCC using two parameters: whether or not Case features move along with NPs, and whether or not PF accesses whole chains.},

I provide both logical and empirical arguments against the view that children should be biased to assume that such a string has a control structure.

Here I address two alternative possibilities. One possibility is that children lack the adult-like restriction that subject and verb must match in animacy, which I counter with evidence from the developmental literature. The other possibility, addressed by the experiment, is that children's control verbs are thematically related to their subject but do not require the subject to be animate. I will argue, instead, that the presence of an expletive/inanimate subject coerces a raising analysis of the verb, and concomitant ``bleached'' semantics of the verb in that context.},

The paper starts out by considering degree questions, which often require an answer picking out the maximal degree from a certain set. However, in some cases, depending on the semantic properties of the question predicate, reference to the minimal degree is required, or neither specifying the maximum nor the minimum is sufficient. What is needed is an operation which defines the maximally informative answer on the basis of the Karttunen question denotation. Shifting attention to non-degree questions, two notions of answerhood are adopted from work by Heim. The first of these is weakly exhaustive adn the second strongly enhaustive. The second notion of answerhood is proven to be equivalent to Groenendijk adn Stokhof's interrogative semantics. On the basis of a wide range of empirical data showing that questions often are not interpreted exhaustively, it is argued that a fairly rich system of semantic objects associated with questions is needed to account for hte various ways in which questions contribute to the semantics and pragmatics of the utterances in which they appear.},

We show that Winter's proposal is insufficient for a number of cases of cumulative readings, and that Krifka's and Sternefeld's polyadic **-operator is needed in addition to dependent definites. Our arguments come from new observations concerning dependent plurals and cluase-boundedness effects with cumulative readings.},

The interpretation of the Japanese comparison construction is determined to a larger extent by pragmatic strategies, as opposed to compositional semantics. The syntactically provided item of comparsion (the constituent accompaying $\backslash$emphyori) does not, in contrast to an English $\backslash$emphthan-clause, have a degree semantics; it ultimately contributes an individual. From this item the real comparison has to be inferred. We argue that Japanese does not have English-style degree operators and probably lacks abstraction over degree variables in the syntax altogether. The proposed analysis accounts for a number of empirical differences between Japanese and English. A more general outcome is that the semantics of comparison is subject to crosslinguistic variation. A parameter of language variation is suggested as the source of the differences we observe.},

The restriction (the Minimal Quantified Structure Cosntraint, MQSC) is that an intervening quantified expression blocks this movement. In the case of every, the MQSC leads to an unambiguously ditributive interpretation of the question.

A compositional semantic analysis of all of these readings is provided in which the reciprocal expression is uniformly represented as 'the other ones among them' (recasting Heim, Lasnik and May 1991a,b). A reciprocal sentenc is thus a special kind of relational plural. Interpretational variability comes about by the same mechanisms of plural predication at work in relational plurals: pluralization operators, LF operations like QR, and addition of contextual information.},

Language-specific linear ordering rules apply to the Verb and Deictics of the DS. A lexically explicit, syntactically complex phrase or clause can be substituted in Surface Structure for a Deictic from the DS. The Deictic or a phonetically null PRO may appear in SS.

In their place, a solution based on Decompostitional or Featural Composition is proposed, in which attributes compose semantically not with the full set of features of their head, but rather with only one particular feature. This solution reduces the wide and narrow scope readings of attribute phrases to a question of which feature is selelcted, in effect making all attribute composition the same and obviating the distinction between wide and narrow scope readings of attribute phrases.},

  title = {Spanish {{Rhotics}} and {{Dominican Hypercorrect}} /{{S}}/},
  volume = {18},
  abstract = {In Dominican Spanish, consonantal reduction in the syllable rhyme is so pervasive that /s/ is systematically absent from this position. Some speakers attempt to emulate more conservative styles by reinserting postnuclear /s/, often resulting in hypercorrection. Epenthesis is unattested before intervocalic taps and trills, which can be explained in terms of structure preservation if the intervocalic trill is analyzed as a heterosyllabic geminate tap (Harris 1983, 2001, 2002, N\'u\~nez Cede\~no 1988, 1989, 1994). The present study reconsiders the issue of rhotic representation in light of the Dominican hypercorrection facts. I show how Padgett's (2003) analysis of Catalan and Spanish, cast within a recent version of Dispersion Theory (Flemming 1995, 2002), offers a simpler account of the behavior of syllable-initial rhotics that does not require a geminate representation. I develop a constraint-based account of epenthesis in which the appearance of non-underlying [s] is driven by a high-ranking output-output correspondence constraint. The failure of hypercorrect [s] to appear before intervocalic rhotics is accounted for by a phonetically-grounded phonotactic constraint against [strident][vibrant] clusters in the output. Since an analysis in terms of surface phonotactics does not require an underlying geminate representation of intervocalic trills in Spanish, it is fully compatible with the Dispersion-theoretic account.},

I propose instead a version of the MTC closer in spirit to Bowers (1973/1986, 1981) in which Merge is driven by interpretable or uninterpretable c-selection features of hte standard sort. I then show that, given standard minimalist assumptions, the MTC is not only possible but necessary.

Our analysis rests on the assumption that the mapping between argument structure and valence is defined by realization constraints which are satisfied by all lexical heads. Arguments can be realized as local dependents, in whcih case they are selected via the head's valence features. Alternatively, arguments may be realized in a long-distance dependency construction, in which case they are selected via the head's SLASH features. Furthermore, we argue that English post-verbal adjuncts, as well as complements, are syntactic dependents selected by the verb, thus providing a uniform analysis of complement and adjunct extractionj. Finally, we show that our analysis provides an alternative treatment of subject extraction and we offer a new account of the that-trace effect.},

Stump (1984) argues that affirmative subject-initial sentences in Breton are ordinary subject-verb sentences. His argument is based on the fact that these sentences show no verbal agreement. Stump suggests that this lack of agreement is an instance of a Complementary Principle, a generalization which states that overt argument NPs do not cooccur with agreement in Breton. In this paper, we show that the empirical generalization underlying Stump's analysis is quite dubious. Moreover, it is impossible to prevent a topicalization analysis for affirmative subject-initial sentences; indeed, evidence from coordination shows that the topicalization analysis must be available. We suggest that the absence of agreement is due to a different generalization: there is no agreement with wh-trace subjects in affirmative clauses. Thus there is no reason to think that Breton has a class of ordinary subject-veb sentences.},

The prepositional complementizer then moves to a higher functional head, and VP moves to the specifier position of this head.

Finite verbs agree with a following pronominal subject, prepositions agree with a following pronominal complement, and a particle which introduces non-finite clauses agrees with a following pronominal subject. Similarly, nouns have a preceding clitic agreeing with a following pronominal possessor, non-finite verbs have a preceding clitic agreeing with a following pronominal object, and what looks like the non-finite form of bod ``be'', which introduces certain subordinate clauses, has a preceding clitic agreeing with a following pronominal subject. There seems to be a single phenomenon here. Approaches that involve an abstract level face problems and there is no evidence that the phenomenon involves an abstract level. It seems quite plausible to suggest that superficial linear order is crucial, and this idea can be implemented in a straightforward way within linearization-based Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG). The properties of agreement also entail that unexpressed noun phrases of various kinds must be represented in the superficial constituent structure and not just at some abstract level, contrary to the view of some frameworks.},

This fact is attributed to a $\backslash$sc coda condition which restricts syllabification to two rime positions, but which no longer holds at the word level. At Level 1, the principle of $\backslash$sc structure preservation (Kiparsky 1985) enforces conformity with the Coda Condition, thus explaining the distribution of complex codas as well as the application of vowel shortening. Apparent exceptions to the Coda Condition result from an independent principle which licenses an additional rime position if the position is half of a partial geminate (Ito 1986). After Level 1, Structure Preservation is turned off, and as a result, syllable structure is less restrictive, allowing larger codas and making vowel shortening unnecessary.},

Random use of functional material is attested in agrammatic speech in which we suggest it may indeed stem from absent or deficient functional structure. On the other hand, the early grammar is characterized by full, albeit phonologically unrealized, functional structures.

  title = {Deconstructing {{Possession}}},
  volume = {28},
  abstract = {The paper argues that clausal possession is to be decomposed into three distinct, independently attested, syntactic configurations, each associated with its own meaning. These include Location, represented as an ordinary small clause, the Part- Whole relation, which always has a complement structure within DP as its source, and an applicative structure ApplP, the source of (in)alienable possession, where humans are treated as special. The analysis we propose focuses on Palestinian Arabic and extends to English clausal possession and its realizations across HAVE and BE. Pales- tinian Arabic overtly distinguishes a number of ingredients which in other languages enter into possession less transparently: It marks Location and Part-Whole relations by distinct prepositions, it features a full-agreement/no-agreement distinction associated with scope, and, lacking HAVE, it keeps separate P and BE, the ingredients often assumed to enter into its composition. The picture which emerges is partly familiar and partly new. We argue that the notion possession is never linguistically encoded as such, since none of the underlying representations proposed is associated exclusively with possession. We also argue that the subject in possessive clauses is a derived subject with both HAVE and BE. We attribute the differences between Palestinian Arabic and English to a difference in their agreement systems, which in conjunction with Economy, forces P to extract from its PP, and leads to the formation of HAVE. If we are correct, the cross-linguistic distribution of HAVE and BE may further reduce to parametric differences in agreement systems.},

I propose that the contrast observed in these contexts should be explained by Case theory, and show that a Case-theoretic approach is superior to an ECP/Binding approach in accounting for the distribution of en in a variety of contexts, including similar contexts in Italian and Catalan. I argue that Case is a feature of the nominal head (N) of a DP, that Case may be checked in configurations other than [Spec, head], and that there is no need for features such as Nominative or Accusative, [+/) Case] being sufficient. The proposal has consequences for Case theory and for checking theory in general. More generally the article is a contribution to the understanding of phenomena that used to be understood in terms of the Empty Category Principle (ECP).

As an alternative, we introduce the MACRO-EVENT PROPERTY (MEP): a construction has the MEP if it packages event representations such that temporal operators necessarily have scope over all subevents. A case study on the segmentation of motion events into macro-event expressions in eighteen genetically and typologically diverse languages has produced evidence of two types of design principles that impact motion-event segmentation: language-specific lexicalization patterns and universal constraints on form-to-meaning mapping.},

On a descriptive level, the behaviour of h-aspire is accounted for with a grammar model that involves a control loop, whose crucial ingredient is listener-oriented faithfulness constraints. These constraints evaluate phonological recoverability, which is the extent to which the speaker thinks the listener will be able to recover the phonological message. On a more reductionist level, however, the pronunciation of h-aspire and its variation is accounted for with a new, very simple, grammar model for bidirectional phonology and phonetics, which uses a single constraint set for the four processes of perception, recognition, phonological production, and phonetic implementation, and in which phonological and phonetic production are evaluated in parallel. In this model, the phenomenon of phonological recoverability is not built in, as in control-loop grammars, but emerges from the interaction of four equally simple learning algorithms.},

The cause of the problem is found in Tesar's use of ``mark-pooling ties,'' indicating that EDCD can be repaired by assuming Anttila's (1997) ``permuting ties'' instead.

We argue that the blocking effect of dative elements is a reflex of a more gneeral locality constraint, 'defective intervention', proposed by Chomsky 2000.

A word order anomaly in Ijo SERIAL VERB CONSTRUCTIONS (SVCs) strongly suggests this, and left-to-right asymmetric c-command among internal arguments of SVCs confirms it. The anomaly is universal among surface right-headed languages with SVCs, indicating that deep left-headedness is universal, as antisymmetry theory predicts (Kayne 1994). Assuming complements are in Specs, and that a light verb v selects every VP (Chomsky 1999), I derive VOVO from OVOV by two instances of V-to-v movement. I argue for a nonuniform approach to SVCs, involving relations of both raising (Campbell 1989) and control (Collins 1997). Other aspects of SVC word order are predictable from a universal thematic hierarchy nontheme theme, and short scrambling (Takano 1998).},

Despite this I argue that a closest c-command based account (Chomsky 2000) is superior to a Spec-head agreement analysis, for two reasons. First, feature-valuation under closest c-command permits a unified treatment of Bantu operator agreement and West Germanic complementizer agreement with subjects. Second, it explains a common requirement that subjects by $\backslash$emphin situ in Bantu A'-movement constructions: a subject raised to Spec, TP would intervene between C's phi-features and the operator in outer Spec, vP that must value them. Like wh-movement, subject raising always coincides with agreement in Bantu; I propose that Bantu uninterpretable phi-features hapve EPP features. These are distinct from the classical EPP of T which, I argue, underlies a verbal agreement requirement giving every Bantu inflectional category a specifier. I show that nominative Case-checking is independent of both agreement and EPP in Bantu.},

Although DPs need Case to participate in Agree relations (Chomsky 2000), deletion-marked Case remains syntactically accessible until the next strong phase (Pesetsky and Torrego 2001), allowing CA and SA to cooccur.

It is argued here that the behaviour of `weak' noun and adjective forms can be best understood if their inflectional suffixes are regarded not as expressing morphosyntactic properties such as gender and case but rather as the outcome of conflicting ranked constraints governing what an optimal noun or adjective should look like in different contexts. For example, an attributive adjective should carry a suffix; a nominative singular form should carry no suffix; and the default inflectional affix is -en. These language-particular constraints reflect some of the `system-defining structural properties' attributed to German by the late Wolfgang Ullrich Wurzel.},

We show, using standard tests for presupposi- tionality, that presupposition of the process component of the bipartite event structure in telics is forced by the assertion of the endpoint component. Presupposed elements are not pragmatically consistent with existentials, hence telic predicates are ruled out in these constructions.

In addition, every conjunct may control past particple agreement: masculine plural and feminine plural conjuncts may resolve as masculine plural, and singular and plural conjuncts may resolve as plural (pure gender and mixed number resolution, respectively). The resolution of mulitple signular conjuncts as plural, however, is rare, attested only once. While the control of agreement by the closest conjunct is the norm, pre-targe first conjuncts, regardless of their gender adn number, may trigger agreement as well. On the other hand, there is no clear textual evidence that pre-target middle conjuncts or post-target remote conjuncts control agreement. Hence, these observations admit the following generalization (taking first conjuncts to be underlying closest conjuncts): the only individual conjunct capable of controlling object-participle agreement is an (underlying) closest conjunct.},

We present two studies examining the processing of a previously unexplored subclass of ellipsis sentence, gapping sentences in which one of the remnants is a preposed PP (PPGs). Like some other gapping structures, PPGs are ambiguous between readings in which a DP remnant is interpreted as a subject or as an object. However, we find that PPGs exhibit a weaker and more flexible object bias than other ambiguous gapping sentences (Carlson 2001a, 2002), one comparable to clausal ellipsis constructions like comparatives and replacives. We argue that this result supports the syntactic assumption that gapping is a nonuniform phenomenon: PPGs involve clausal conjunction on either reading, much like comparative ellipsis, while regular gapping has a nonellipsis alternative (Johnson 1996), which underlies the strong preference for an object reading.},

The GEN operators produce tripartitie matrix/restrictor structures; the main discourse connection among the sentences is that the restrictor produced by each sentence in sequence has as its contents the information in the matrix produced by the previous sentence in the discourse. We also argue that an identity of reference times is required for this process to occur. In the end generic passages are a natural product of the interatction of generic operators in sentences with independently-established principles structuring ordinary extensional narrative.},

While restructuring can be recursive, clitics appear either on the restructured infinitive (no clitic climbing) or in the functional domain of the highest verb (full clitic climbing). There is no clitic climbing to an intermediate restructuring verb. We argue that only the lowest restructured verb makes a position for clitics available and that this position is the same as that of infinitive-final [e]. Finally, we show that the funcitonal - lexical dichotomy is too sharp and that a variety of verb classes must be admitted, whose properties correlate with the point in the sturcture in which they are merged.},

I show that Ouhalla's predictions are wrong regarding Spanish and Fiorentino; that subject extraction in these langauges (and in Galegan, Italian and Piedmontese) proceeds from postverbal position in both embedded and main clauses; and that the antiagreement effect results from the different nature of the expletive subjects licensed in these languages.},

Three categories of clusters are distinguished: (1) those that may be reduced in all lexical items (unrestricted simplification), (2) those that may be reduced in some lexical items but not in others (lexicallydetermined simplification), (3) those that are always stable. Consonant deletion is motivated by two distinct factors: the Sonority Sequencing Principle and a principle requiring that every segment be perceptually salient. The likelihood that a consonant deletes correlates with the degree to which it violates one of these principles. Appeal to perceptual factors explains in particular two tendencies. First, final stops are less susceptible to deletion than other consonants. Second, cluster simplification correlates with the amount of contrast within the cluster, in terms of voicing, manner and place of articulation. This analysis of cluster reduction supports the integration of perception in phonological theory advocated in a growing body of work. It is formalized within Optimality Theory and uses in particular perceptually-motivated markedness and faithfulness constraints militating against perceptually weak segments.},

We analyze 423 tokens from spoken and written corpora, which we take to represent a subset of a speaker's experience with these constructions. The analysis, based on token frequency and semantic similarity, leads to the organization of tokens with two of the verbs into dense clusters of semantically related adjectives centered on a high-frequency exemplar. The other two verbs are used with more diverse sets of adjectives. We supplement the initial analysis with an experiment in which speakers were asked to rate the semantic similarity of pairs of adjectives. When subjected to multidimensional scaling, the results of the experiment support the initial analysis. We argue that novel instances of verb adjective sequences are based on analogies to previous experience and not on rules that refer to abstract features. In a second experiment, speakers judged the acceptability of sentences taken from the corpora; the results showed that high-frequency expressions and expressions semantically similar to the high-frequency ones lead to an expression being judged more acceptable. Overall the results support exemplar representations, which are heavily based on usage experience.},

It is shown that particular instances of constructions can acquire their own pragmatic, semantic, and phonological characteristics. In addition, it is argued that high-frequency instances of constructions undergo grammaticization processes (which produce further change), function as the central members of categories formed by constructions, and retain their old forms longer than lower-frequency instances under the pressure of newer formations.

Such mismatches give rise to violations of what I call Double Prosody constraints. The proposals in this paper critically support the covert weight analysis of compensatory lengthening and the formalization of opacity of Goldrick (2000) and they readdress longstanding problems in Latin and Romance linguistics. Here, I maintain, contra previous analyses, that the stress computation for Late Latin is the same as that of Preclassical Latin but that, by Late Latin, double prosody violations had become frequent in the stressed penultimate syllable, obscuring a once transparent relationship between prosody and segmentism.},

  volume = {8},
  abstract = {A well-known problem in Chinese phonology is that in some dialects most regular syllables keep their underlying tones, but in others the initial syllable determines the tonal pattern of a multisyllabic domain. Mandarin and Shanghai, two of the most studied dialects, best represent the contrast. Duanmu (1993) proposes that the two dialects differ in syllable structure but otherwise obey the same phonological constraints, including moraic trochee. However, a number of problems remain, such as questions regarding the metrical counting units, the precited weight of a syllable and its phonetic duration, the economy of underlying tones, the mechanism of tone deletion, and the relation between weight and stress. This article offers a solution to the problems. The main proposal is that Chinese is both mora-counting and syllable-counting, in that a heavy syllable forms a bimoraic trochee, which I call M-foot, yet a minimal word must be a disyllabic trochee, which I call a S-foot. In addition, both Madnarin adn Shanghai are subject to toanl polarity, which is independently found in African languages. I also discuss the implication of the S-foot for metrical theory and other consequences of the present analysis.},

We present data from Vietnamese which indicate that wh-in situ can be interpreted by either covert movement or unselective binding without movement. Covert movement takes place in matrix questions that lack a question particle, while unselective binding is used when there is a question particle and in embedded questions generally. The Vietnamese data also show that covert movement observes the same constraints\textemdash{}in particular, Subjacency\textemdash{}as overt movement. The correlation between unselective binding and the question particle in matrix questions appears to support recent theoretical views of question particles (e.g., Cheng, 1991), but we argue that this is only apparent. The question particle merely serves a syntactic licensing function, and this function is borne by a question- embedding verb in embedded questions, meaning that it is not inherent to question particles as such. The question particle in Vietnamese actually serves an unrelated semantic function: it indicates realis mood and induces a presupposition. The implication is that question particles are only indirectly related to wh-in situ, if they are related at all.},

The rigidity of two object quantifiers follows the pattern of multiple instances of movement crosslinguistically (multiple wh-movement, multiplie A-scrambling, multiple object shift): movement paths cross, reccreating the hierarchical order of the moving elements (Richards 1997). Hypothesizing that quantifier scope is derived by quantifier-specific syntactic movement, movement that is constrained in the same way as other types of movement, permits these phenomena to be unified under accounts of Relativized Minimality effects generally.},

I argue against this conclusion, showing that the grammar clearly distinguishes double object from prepositional dative constructions. Under certain circumstances, the first object of a double object construction can shift to the right, with the preposition to appearing, but the grammar still distinguishes this from a prepositional dative construction that looks identi- cal on the surface. The phenomena that I investigate are scope interactions with quantifiers and locative inversion. In addition, the rightward reordering operations investigated here indicate that constraints on variable binding, including weak crossover, must be formulated in terms of linear order rather than hierarchy.},

We show that the evidence on the first of these questions is somewhat contradictory, but that even in cases where the syntactic evidence argues that these verbs do not combine with two noun phrases to form a single noun phrase, they still have a meaning closer to that of and than of with.},

Both pictures showed extra objects (e.g., alligators or bathtubs) not in correspondence, with correct sentence interpretation requiring their attention. Children younger than 9 years made numerous errors, with poorer performance in distributive contexts than collective ones. In Experiment 3, 21 native, English-speaking adults, given a similar task with the distributive quantifier every, also made childlike errors. The persistence of quantifier-spreading errors in adults undermines accounts positing immature syntactic structures as the error source. Rather, the errors seemingly reflect inaccurate syntax to semantics mapping, with adults and children alike resorting to processing shortcuts.},

Both rest on highly dubious background assumpti ons. Addi tionally, even grant i ng these assumptions, both arguments are flawed in similar ways. There are numerous additional problems both with H's account of quantifier scope and control and with his arguments against chains. If we take chains to be interpretively constructed, then multiple copies in chains may not differ from other multiple occurrences of lexical items (or structures constructed from lexical items) with respect to their origin. In all cases, multiple occurrences are due to a (set of) element(s) being selected from the lexicon more than once. Multiple occurrences can then be interpreted as chains when they are in the (thematically) appropriate type of identity relation. This approach not only dispenses with syntax-internal chains, as H justifiably desires, but also eliminates the additional unmotivated, arbitrary, and redundant syntactic mechanism of movement that he (and the minimalist framework in general) assumes.},

This article shows that case distribution in Finnish is sensitive to certain nontrivial structural properties of those DPs. This makes it possible to use case distribution as a tool to investigate the internal structure of a variety of DPs, including nominalized clauses. It is argued, based on such new evidence, that (i) there exists a syntactic nominalizer head n within various kinds of nominal phrases, and that (ii) genitive argument DPs of nominalized clauses undergo raising analogous to the EPP-triggered DP raising in finite clauses. Furthermore, these genitive arguments are base-generated below the nominalizer head n. Implications involving recent theories of Agree, valuation, and phrasal movement are discussed.},

  abstract = {This paper is an attempt to solve the somewhat elusive polarity item licensing properties of wh-questions in Swedish. As has been observed by Klima (1964) for English, NPIs are generally not compatible with genuinely information seeking wh-questions, but tend to induce rhetorical interpretations. Distinguishing between thre types of wh-questions and the kind of information they request, I will systematically review the syntactic, semantic and pragmatic properties of each wh-type. Based on that overview, I argue that NPI-licensing in wh-questions is dependent on the relation bewteen teh implication of existence associated with the wh-word and the presupposition induced by the expressed proposition. According to my analysis, wh-words shouldnot be regarded as NPI-licensing operators, Being place-holders, wh-words inherit whatever properties are associated with the item they replace. The licensing property of the wh-word is thus dependent on the licensing property of the referent. Thus, only wh-words referring to downward entailing expressions will license NPIs in their scope (e.g. when pointing to an empty set). Such wh-questions tend to be interpreted rhetorically.},

  volume = {14},
  abstract = {In earlier work, we developed an approach to clause-internal composition in which predicates can be composed with arguments by operations other than Function Application, and it makes a difference which composition operation is employed. Here we take our approach further by examining two nonsaturating operations that combine property contents: Restrict, which composes a predicate with the property content of an indefinite; and Modify, which is involved in predicate modification. Nonsaturating operations that combine property contents are often formalized in terms of predicate intersection, which is commutative. Using evidence from the Austronesian language Chamorro, we argue that Restrict and Modify are not `commutative', but instead incorporate an asymmetry: they take one content to supply a domain that is narrowed further by combination with the other content. Syntactically, it is transparent which category's content supplies the domain. But semantically, this information can be recovered only from the way in which the composition operation affects the contents that it composes, since\textemdash{}as we show\textemdash{}the same contents can be composed with distinct results.},

The effects of syntax on phonology are mediated by prosodic structure, a representation of prosodic constituents calculated from syntactic structure but not isomorphic to it. Within this overall architecture, I investigate the placement of weak pronouns in the Austronesian language Chamorro. Certain Chamorro pronominals can be realized as prosodically deficient weak pronouns that typically occur right after the predicate. I show that these pronouns are second-position clitics whose placement is determined not syntactically, but prosodically: they occur after the leftmost phonological phrase of their intonational phrase. My analysis of these clitics assumes that lexical insertion is late and can affect and be affected by prosodic phrase formation \textendash{} assumptions consistent with the view that the mutual interaction of phonology and syntax is confined to the postsyntactic operations that translate syntactic structure into prosodic structure.},

I then bring the word order of restructuring to bear on the larger issue of how verb-initial order is derived. Along the way, an account is developed in which some of the distinctive characteristics of restructuring are determined in the synatx, but others are the result of post-Spell-Out operations.},

  volume = {15},
  abstract = {This paper focuses on the Korean suffix -te, which has been variously analyzed as a marker of tense, aspect, tense\textendash{}aspect, mood, mood\textendash{}tense, or evidentiality. I argue against all of these approaches and propose instead that -te is a spatial deictic past tense, which triggers an evidential environment. It refers to a certain past time when the speaker either observed an event or some evidence of the event within his (her) perceptual field. Thus, the denotation of -te is `overlap', not between the speaker's perceptual field and the event itself, but between the speaker's perceptual field and the evidence of the event at the past reference time. To account for this denotation, I propose an `evidence trace' function as well as a `speaker's perceptual trace' function (cf. M. Faller, J Semantics 21:45\textendash{}85, 2004). My analysis shows that suffixes like -ess (which is traditionally analyzed as a perfect) play two roles, as an indirect evidential and a perfect, depending on whether they appear with the spatial deictic tense -te or with a simple deictic tense. I argue that in Korean two distinct tense systems\textemdash{}the regular tense\textendash{}aspect system and the spatial deictic tense\textendash{}evidential system\textemdash{}exist in parallel. Thus the proposed analysis allows evidentials to be subsumed under the formal theory of tense, aspect, and mood.},

These techniques were developed in the context of L2 Universal Grammar (UG) research on the acquisition of reflexives in order to address two problems: the difficulty of applying traditional correlation measures to more than two data groups, and the limitations of statistical techniques when faced with small sample sizes. These previously unused tools within the research arena of applied linguistics were found to be flexible as well as easy to use and interpret. They also take advantage of recent advances in data-visualization software for the PC. By visualizing and analyzing the emergence of two or more linguistic properties in the interlanguage grammar, these techniques enable the researcher to address the question of whether or not multiple properties associated with one UG parameter or principle emerge in the interlanguage grammar in a manner or sequence consistent with those principles and parameters.},

Research has naturally focused on I-langauges and UG, the problems of descriptive and explanatory adequacy. The Principles and Paramters approach opened the possibility for serious investigation of the third factor, and the attempt to account for properties of language in terms of general considerations of computational efficiency, elimintaing some of the technology postulated as specific to langauge and providing more principled explanation of linguistic phenomena.},

The alternations occur between mid and low vowels adn between midvowels and diphthongs in stressed position. Diphthongization is treated as vowel lowering under stress. Departing from previous analyses, all three alternations are shown to be part of the same process, both phonologically and morphologically conditioned. The surface distribution of vowels and diphthongs falls out from the interaction of two conflicting forces acting on the stressed vowel of the seem: the pressure on the vowel to lower under stress, and the pressure to rise in a metaphony process conditioned by the vowel of an inflectional suffix. The analysis relies on the interaction of markedness and faithfulness constraints. The latter include a constraint responsible for metaphony, defined as an instance of faithfulness between the vowel of the stem and that of the suffix. Besides allowing a unified treatment of all three alterantions, this analysis also reveals the typological relation of Romanian to other languages whose stress systems are sensitive to vowel height. The morphological distribution of vowels and diphthongs is accounted for by morphologically specific instantiations of constraints outranking the general, phonological ones.},

The proposal is based on a ``recursive,'' grammatically driven approach to scalar implicatures that breaks with the traditional view that scalar implicatures arise via postgrammatical pragmatic processes. The main claim is that scalar items optionally activate scalar alternatives that, when activated, are then recursively factored into meaning via an alternative sensitive operator similar to only.

The participants for each experiment were 80 Chinese-speaking children between the ages of 3 and 8, plus 16 adults (recruited from Taipei, Taiwan). The results of the study indicate the following points: (1) Chinese children, in early stages of language acquisition (even as young as 3 years), honor the grammatical count-mass distinction which, as suggested by Cheng and Sybesma (1998, 1999), is reflected at the level of the classifier. (2) chinese children are capable of making fine differentiations between and among a given set of count-classifiers. They know that the relationship bewteen a count-classifier and an entity dentoed by a noun is relatively fixed. (3) Chinese children's abilities in dealing with mass-classifiers are comparable to their abilities in dealing with count-classifiers. (4) Although there are developmental differences across the classifiers tested (presumably due to lexical learning), these differences tend to fade by age 4. (5) The general classifier $\backslash$emphge differed in that it does not require that the entity denoted by the noun be of a particular type. This was seen even in adults to some degree. The results of this study cohere with the linguistic analysis proposed by Cheng and Sybesma that the count-mass distinction is in fact relevant in chinese grammar. These results also cohere with the current theory in cognitive development proposed by Soja, Carey and Spelke (1991) that the ontological constraint reflected in the count-mass distinction is available in early stages of language acquisition.},

The first half of this paper identifies the negative assertion as the primary meaning of the NWH construction, in addition to two conventional implicatures. In the second half, I argue that the grammatical features in NWHCs in Chinese, Korean, and Japanese strongly suggest that NWHCs should be analyzed as interrogative wh-questions. The quantification domain of NWH-words is the sets of propositions that pick out the conversational backgrounds of the sentence (Kratzer 1977; Portner 2009). The NWHC can be paraphrased as ``What is the proposition q such that in view of q, p is true?'' However,the interrogative question can only receive a negative rhetorical interpretation (i.e., a question without a true answer) because the conventional implicatures make it impossible for p to be true against any of the conversational backgrounds.},

  abstract = {The use of the Dislocation Focus Construction (DFC) (also known as ``Right Dislocation'') in colloquial Chinese (including Cantonese and Mandarin) gives rise to various non-canonical word orders. In DFCs, the sentence particle (SP) occurs in a sentence-medial position. The pre- and post-SP materials are demonstrated to be syntactically connected, based on four diagnostic tests, namely (i) the zinghai `only' test, (ii) the doudai (``wh-the-hell'') test, (iii) polarity item licensing, and (iv) Principle C violations. The findings offer new insights into the syntax of the Chinese left periphery and constraints on focus movement. First, the observations entail that Chinese CPs are head-initial, and an XP is obligatorily moved around the SP to a position higher than the CP. Second, the XP-raising in the DFC is argued to be driven by focus because of the focus interpretation induced. It is discovered that the focus movement is subject to the Spine Constraint, which turns out to be remarkably similar to the properties of the Nuclear Stress Rule (e.g., selection of focus set and metrical invisibility). It is argued that the DFC is the syntactic realization of the rule.},

Cheng (1989: 1993). We believe that all the phenomena shown by the specific referential renjia 'people-home' fall under the notion of sympthetic antilogophoricity. That is, whenever the speaker attempts to appeal to the addressee's sympathy (or agreement) in his (or her) thoughts or feel, he/she usually uses the specific referental renjia 'people-home' and has it take as reference some identifiable or unidentifiable external protagonist(s) other than the speaker or the addressee, or someone who plays a pragmatically downgraded logphoric role in teh discourse, namely the downgraded speaker or addressee. CAses involving either a speaker-reference or an addressee-reference can be regarded as an extension of core sympathetic antilogophoricity, which is limited to cases of reference to an external protagonist other than the speaker or the addressee. Only in a non-core case of sympathetic antilogophoricity is it a necessary property of the sympathetic antilogophor renjia 'people-home' that its antecedent denotes an individual consceious of the relevant even tbeing reported. The differences between the specific referential renjia 'people-home' and English epithets (i.e., antilogophors) lead to our claim: there exist at least two types of antilogophors and the notion of sympathy plays an important role in interpreting some type of antilogophors.},

Burzio's unaccusative analysis of the Italian auxiliary phenomenon is ad hoc with respect to the selection of essere with si-impersonal and fails to account for the occurrence of verbs such as correre 'to run' with both essere and avere. Also earlier semantic descriptions of the phenomenon cannot account for the occurrence of essere with si-constructions, and do not provide independent criteria to attribute semantic structures to verbs and semantic roles to arguments.},

From a syntactic standpoint, we argue that PROREL clauses are correlative constructions on a par with left-adjoined relative clauses investigated for Hindi by Dayal (Locality in WH quantification: Questions and relative clauses in Hindi. Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1996). On the semantic side, we argue however that unlike Hindi correlatives, PROREL clauses lack restrictive interpretations and are interpreted instead as subject-predicate structures. In this respect, they are similar to Japanese internally headed relative clauses (IHRCs) investigated by Shimoyama (Journal of East Asian Linguistics 8:147\textendash{}182, 1999). We propose that like Japanese IHRCs in Shimoyama's proposal, PROREL clauses are related to the main clause via e-type anaphora.},

Chomsky 2001a, b) and an Economy Condition that requires that each step of (possibly successive cyclic) QR be motivated (cf. Fox 1999). After showing why QR is local in typical cases, I consider new evidence, involving a counterpart of ACD in Italian, which indicates that QR takes place long distance, as other types of A-bar movement do, whenever each step is independently motivated. It follows that it can be maintained that the locality conditions on QR are $\backslash$emphnot construction specific, as expected given the general format of the theory.},

Results indicated that 3-year-olds were producing 35\% of transitive structures with object omission, and 4- and 5-year-olds were producing around 15\% of transitive structures with object omission. The production of clitic pronouns increased with age, and the change happened primarily between the ages of three and four. The results failed to find a relation between omissions and substitutions. These results suggest that there is an early object optionality stage for young Spanish-speaking children and are compatible with approaches that predict some degree of object optionality for all languages.},

  abstract = {This paper revisits the classic tests for movement that have been proposed in the literature on dislocated structures, arguing that discourse factors have a significant impact on the outcome of such tests. On this basis, French dislocation is shown to be a syntactically unified phenomenon involving both Left- and Right-Dislocation, irrespective of whether it is resumed by a clitic or a non-clitic element. The epitome of interface phenomena, French dislocation is argued to be the output of the interaction between syntax and the discourse component, requiring only a very limited contribution of narrow syntax: all that is required is that the dislocated element be merged by adjunction to a Discourse Projection (defined as a maximal projection with root properties). No agreement or checking of a designated (e.g. topic) feature is necessary, hence no syntactic movement of any sort need be postulated. The so-called resumptive element is argued to be a full-fledged pronoun rather than a true syntactic resumptive. The relation between the dislocated element and its resumptive is captured in terms of discourse coreference. The core syntactic and interpretive properties of left- and right-dislocation are shown to be identical; differences between the two configurations are shown to derive straightforwardly from the properties of the two sides of the clause periphery.},

Analyses of elision have, virtually without exception, simply stipulated which vowel is elided, for example, by encoding this information directly in a langauge-specific rule. This implies that the targeted position is not predictable, but simply a matter of which of two equally available options is selected by the language. A cross-linguistic study suggests, however, that this is not strictly the case, but that in some environments the choice of target is universally determined. This article accounts for the observed restrictions on elision target within a constraint-based theory which claims that langauges preferentially preserve phonological elements in certain prominent positions.},

This paper examines Condition C-defying dependencies in one such language, St'\'at'imcets (Lillooet Salish). It is shown here that Condition C violations in St'\'at'imcets are not confined to coreference anaphora, since they may involve sloppy identity; however they are limited to cases where the dependency (a) does not contain a quantificational expression and (b) crosses a clause boundary. Employing a version of linking theory, this paper argues that Condition C-defying dependencies are ``upside-down''\textemdash{}rather than involving a name unexpectedly depending on a c-commanding pronoun, they involve a dependent pronoun c-commanding an antecedent name. In order to account for this possibility, a parametrized version of the Independence Principle (Safir 2004b) is invoked, whose domain in St'\'at'imcets is restricted to the minimal clause. The facts here provide a direct challenge to the Universalist Hypothesis on anaphora.},

The answer, obtained by means of the historical comparative linguistics and the reconstruction of Proto-Romance, is that this compound type must have been productive during antiquity in Spoken Latin, as a popular means of coining everyday terms for animals, plants, instruments and place names. It may be that, previous to its Latin origin, it goes back to Indo-European.},

This article explores the hypothesis that lack of an object marker when the object is indefinite follows from lack of abstract Case on indefinite objects. It is shown that indefinites in Hebrew are allowed in various other positions in which Case seems to be unavailable and in which definites are not allowed, a fact that receives a straightforward account under the proposed hypothesis that indefinites do not require Case. The possibility of having Caseless indefinites is then argued to follow from lack of a DP projection in Hebrew indefinites. The second part of this article aims to show that an analysis of indefinites in Hebrew as lacking a DP projection is indeed possible and can be motivated on independent grounds. This involves a reexamination of the arguments that have motivated the influential N-to-D analysis of Semitic noun phrases. I claim that most previous work on Semitic nominals is in fact compatible with an analysis in which nouns do not raise as high as the D position, and that the hypothesis that indefinites in Hebrew are not full DPs has some explanatory advantages over the view that all construct state nominals in Hebrew are DPs.},

The key to this puzzle lies at the syntax-semantics interface: plural adjectives are required in cases of NATURAL COORDINATION, where a salient close relation holds between the conjuncts, but disallowed in cases of ACCIDENTAL COORDINATION. The semantic distinction between natural and accidental coordination has a syntactic reflex in Finnish, where only the features of the natural-coordination structure are compatible with the agreement requirements of plural adjectives. We show that the distinction between natural and accidental coordination is syntactically reflected not only in Finnish, but in other languages as well, including Tundra Nenets, Russian, and Kurdish.*},

  volume = {16},
  abstract = {Russian has two different means of combining two noun phrases to form a plural noun phrase: the coordinate construction (using i 'and') and the comitative construction (using s'with'). The two constructions are associated with different readings for certain sentences. In particular, whereas in certain cases the comitative construction allows only for a collective reading. This difference has been ascribed to a difference in denotation of the two types of phrases. We show that such an analysis is unsatisfactory and propose an alternative anlysis that appeals to pragmatic factors. In particular, we claim that distributive readings are dispreferred in the absence of an overt distributive operator and that pragmatic differences between the types of noun phrases riase the saliency of their subgroups to different degrees, thus making distributive readings more difficult to obtain with comitatives.},

Our account relies on the technical mechanisms of agreement as outlined in Chomsky (1995, 2001), in particular a variant of Chomsky's (2008) proposal regarding feature inheritance by non-phase heads of features belonging to phase heads, combined with Gallego's (2006) notion of phase-sliding. We also utilise some aspects of Mueller's (2004) analysis of ergativity, and propose an account of a typological generalisation regarding the absence of person-driven auxiliary selection first put forward in Kayne (2000:127) in the Germanic languages. To the extent that the analyses proposed successfully apply the mechanisms put forward in the recent versions of the minimalist program, the postulation of these mechanisms is supported by our analysis with evidence from a new empirical domain. We also offer some general speculations regarding auxiliary selection in general.},

This paper explores the interpretation of null objects (NOs) in French from this perspective. Previous accounts have determined two major classes based on the referentiality of the NO; however, these analyses end up, paradoxically, with a semantically vague description of the difference, resorting to undefined notions of identifiability, topic/focus, or probably reference. Starting from the assumption that all NOs are syntactically represented, we tease apart the contributions of syntax, semantics, and pragmatics, which turn out to be simple and straightforward. We propose a typology comprising two syntactic types of NO; further nuances are a function of the varying contributions of verbal semantics and pragmatics.},

However, treating it as syntactically subordinate results in an unnatural account of its superficially coordinate structure. Thus, the binding and quantification effects must be due to subordination at the level of conceptual structure, not syntactici structure. In addition, certain extraction and inversion phenomena in the left-hand cluase are consistent only with its being coordinated in syntactici structure. A striking consequence is that the Coordinate Structure Constraint holds at conceptual structure, whereas Condition on Extraction Domain effects are strictly syntactic. The left-subordinating and-construction is thus another example of a significant mismatch between syntactic structure and semantic representation.},

  abstract = {Historically, control in generative grammar has fallen within the province of syntactic theory. One primary reason for this is that Mainstream Generative Grammar (MGG) has imposed a strong uniformity criterion on analyses as a measure of their explanatory adequacy. One aspect of this uniformity criterion, which we call Interface Uniformity, holds that the syntax-semantics interface is maximally simple, in that meaning maps transparently into syntactic structure, and that it is maximally uniform, so that the same meaning always maps into the same syntactic structure. It follows from Interface Uniformity that a nonfinite VP has a syntactic subject that is assigned its external h-role. We argue that this view is most sustainable if one does not take into account the full richness and complexity of control phenomena, but treats control strictly in terms of complementation. When a fuller range of phenomena is taken into account, it appears that it is preferable to ``turn over control'' to the semantics, which is better equipped to capture the facts.We outline how to formulate the syntax-semantics interface so as to get the semantic facts to line up properly with the syntactic facts. This analysis of the interface extends naturally to raising.},

We also discuss the circumstances in which a n overt cmoplementizer and a robustly inflected verb license pro, rendering the clitic redundant. The comparative interest of this dialect is that it reveals synchronically the three mechanisms of pro licensing available in Romance diachronically. These are (a) association with rich verbal inflection, (b) government by a complementizer, and (c) doubling by a clitic.

  volume = {9},
  abstract = {This paper deals with an elliptical construction in Hungarian that to our knowledge has not received any attention in the theoretical literature so far. It involves the deletion of a relative clause with the exclusion of the relative pronoun and one more remaining constituent. We show that this construction should be analyzed as an instance of sluicing. The theoretical approach we provide for these sentences is an adapted version of Merchant's (2001) implementation of sluicing in terms of an [e]-feature that is responsible for the deletion process. Our extension of this proposal involves the modification of the syntactic subcontent of this [e]-feature. We show that languages where question words are found in the operator domain of the left periphery use a version of the [e]-feature that attaches to heads whose specifier is occupied by an operator. This predicts that sluicing not only occurs with wh-remnants but more widely with operator remnants as well. With this proposal we lay the foundation for a crosslinguistic taxonomy of sluicing constructions, and open new avenues towards explaining root/embedded asymmetries in some as yet ill-understood elliptical phenomena in English.},

  abstract = {This paper examines the properties of a grammatical construction called a predicate cleft (PC), which occurs in a regional dialect of English, Trinidad Dialectal English (TDE), spoken on the Eastern Caribbean island of Trinidad. The examination of the PC in TDE is of typological interest inasmuch as it resembles similar constructions in certain West African languages. A PC renders focus or contrastive focus to a verb in a given sentence by copying the verb and preposing it. Similar verb focusing constructions have been observed for many West African languages, including Vata and Nweh, as well as for Caribbean Creoles (Koopman 1984, Piou 1982). The PC in TDE is also of theoretical interest when combined with wh-question formation; the wh-subject/object asymmetries explored here provide interesting support for an escape hatch for whphrases in an intermediate position between VP and Tense that is comparable to a VP-adjoined position (Chomsky 1986). Evidence is also provided for a CP-like domain lower in the clause; I argue that both a wh-phrase and a verb focused in a PC have focus features that must be checked in a Focus Phrase (FocP). The current investigation enriches the characterization of both PCs and wh-question formation by looking not only at each operation individually but also examining their interaction with one another as well as with adverbs.},

A small universal set of monovalent interpretable features and a set of entailment relations among them provide the basis for a principled account of the tense systems of English and Spanish. While each feature, each lexical item, and each vocabulary item has a unified representation, surface polysemy is shown to arise from the mappings between them. Crosslinguistic variation is shown to arise from the different features chosen by each language and from the ways in which each language assembles its features into lexical items and vocabulary items. In addition, the presence or absence of a dependent feature F in a given language is shown to have important consequences for the semantic interpretation of the feature dominating F. These three possible differences interact to produce the significant superficial differences between the tense systems of the two languages.},

According to my restatement of Cinque's (1988) generalizations, [+/- arg] features are not needed. I assume a constrained theory of passivization, according to which the suspended Agent role cannot surface in the syntax as either -en or SE.

Taking a comparative analysis of French $\backslash$emphde and Thai $\backslash$emphThii as its point of departure, this paper argues for a maximally generalized account of the noun phrases in which linkers occur, in terms of DP-internal Predicate Inversion. This approach prompts an analysis of relative-clause constructions that recognizes relative clauses as predicates of DP-internal small clauses, combining the attractions of the traditional approach adn teh Vergnaud/Kayne raising approach by assigning relative clauses an internal structure similar to the traditional one while giving it the external distribution of a predicate by treating it as the predicate of a noun-phrase-internal small clause. For noun-complement cluases, teh approach leads to a revitalization of Stowell's (1981) predication approach to the relationship between teh head noun adn the clause, the latter serving as the former's subject in a DP-contained small-clause structure. A uniform linker approach to French $\backslash$emphde, Tha $\backslash$emphthii, Mandarin Chinese $\backslash$emphde, Japnaese $\backslash$emphno, and so on (a) emphasizes the pervasiveness of Predicate Inversion in the noun phrase, (b) confirms the role of linkers as purely functional aides to the inversion operation, (c) furthers our understanding of the structure and derivaiton of complex noun phrases, and (d) presents a particularly interesting window on microparametric variation in the syntax of noun phrases.},

We lay out the key data supporting this claim, embed the PI nature of wh-the-hell phrases in the theory of polarity developed in Giannakidou 1998, 1999, 2001, and establish the link between the lexical content of these phrases and their PI status by identifying the wh-the-hell as a dependent PI. WE subsequently exploit the PI status of wh-the-hell to explain the more familiar puzzles mentioned above, showing that these are not peculiarities specific to the wh-the-hell but manifestations of the general properties of the class of PIs that wh-the-hell belongs to. The syntactic aspects of the polarity analysis of the wh-the-hell are shown to have important consequences for the fundamental properties of wh-movement in English.},

The syntactically complex structure of unhappier and ungrammaticality that underlies the checking approach to syntactic word formation is supported on the basis of evidence from polarity item licensing, adverbial modification, and so-anaphora.},

I argue that the essential difference between Verb Raising and Verb Projection Raising constructions is the presence in the latter of a TP in the complement of the matrix verb, a TP whose presence is forced by minimalist locality considerations and whose presence is empirically supported by several properties of VPR constructions, including temporal adverbial modification and cluster-contained subjects in transitive expletive constructions with VPR. The analysis of V(P)R also leads to the conclusion that the Continental West Germanic langauges feature a SCRAMBLING opration distinct from Case-driven NP-movement, a conclusion to which the scope facts of double object Ver (Porjection) Raising constructions lend empirical support.},

Challenging previous analyses in which the acquisition of relative clauses has been explained by the varying distance between filler and gap, we propose a multifactorial analysis in which the acquisitionprocess is determined primarily by the similarity betweenthe various types of relative clauses and their relationship to simple sentences.},

This paper examines the relevant data from Yiddish, and concludes on the basis of a number of tests that the underlying word order in the VP is VO. Among the diagnostic tests used are the semantic constraints placed on shifted objects in Yiddish; that is, they must be definite or specific/generic. It is proposed that this constraint is due to a general interpretation condition which requires the fixing of scope relations in the syntax (relying on the notion of semantically-driven movement developed in Diesing and Jelinek 1995). Examination of the reordering possibilities in Yiddish in comparison with both West Continental Germanic and Scandinavian leads to the conclusion that Yiddish allows scrambling (rather than object shift), placing it in a unique position among the VO Germanic languages. The paper concludes with a discussion of semantically-driven movement in the context of economy conditions such as those proposed by Chomsky (1995).},

A puzzling fact about the stem construction is that the verbal elements seem to reflect an OV order, while Yiddish is in other respects a VO language. Thsi OV-like ordering is a consequence of incorporation. A second, more restricted, type of light vrb construction in Yiddish is also discussed, in which the thematic element is an indefinite NP complement. Here there is no AspP; the light verb takes a VP complement which is headed by a null verb which itself takes the predicate nominal as its complement. In both constructions, light verb semantically selects for a complement which denotes some sort of diminutivized event; the differing distribution of the verbal and nominal forms of the light verb construction results from semantic differences betrween the Asp operator and the indefinite determiner.},

Derivations are compared and only the most economical succeeds; thus, the optional movement outcome is not expected, and accounting for truly optional movement becomes an interesting question. I solve this problem by allowing optional selection of C from the lexicon. If C and its wh feature appear in the numeration, it will prompt raising of a wh feature and its accompanying wh phrase to check off the wh feature in C. If C does not appear in the numeration, then no wh movement takes place. It is shown how this proposal can account for the position of wh phrases in simple, complex, and embedded quesitons, as well as account for scope facts in Babine-Witsuwit'en. The role of C in other languages \textendash{} its selection from the lexicon and the projection of C by certain verbs \textendash{} is also briefly discussed.},

Making syntactic generalizations often entails learning the semantics of different verbs, complicating and delaying the acquisition process. This study investigates four- to twelve-yearolds' and adults' knowledge of animacy hierarchy restrictions on postverbal word order in Sesotho double object applicatives, constructions where verb semantics is kept constant. Performance on forced-choice elicited production tasks showed that four-year-olds have early knowledge of the animacy hierarchy restrictions, providing evidence of syntactic generalization even on low-frequency constructions. Although there were no verb frequency effects, performance was also better on the highest-frequency animacy constructions. The results suggest that learning restrictions on verb-argument structure is facilitated when verb semantics is not a confound, but that construction frequency also plays a role in mastering the argument structure of verbs.},

The opposition between N- and NP-raising is central to the ongoing debate about the internal representation of DPs, yet it often eludes testing by syntactic means alone. As we show in this study, the two syntactic hypotheses are instead neatly distinguished by the distinct prosodic phrasing predicted by each operation. In this paper, we present the results of an empirical experiment designed to test the prosodic phrasing of N-A and A-N sequences in Italian and the corresponding syntactic implications. As prosodic cues, we use syllabic and word lengthening effects induced by phonological phrase boundaries. According to our results, A and N share the same phonological phrase in both orders. Regarding the syntactic implications of this finding, we show that under all current models of syntax-prosody mapping the underlying syntactic structure responsible for the attested prosodic phrasing must necessarily rely on N-raising. Finally, we propose an analysis of Italian DPs where the N-raising operation found necessary in light of the attested prosodic phrasing is reconciled with the evidence for DP-internal phrasal movement discussed in Cinque (2005 2006).},

In English, the construction occurs in two alternating word orders ($\backslash$emphThey called off the concert vs. $\backslash$emphThey called the concert off). In German, on the other hand, only one order is possible ($\backslash$emphSie sagten das Konzert ab vs. $\backslash$emph*She sagten ab das Konzert; *Se absagten das Konsert). The central question is why this kind of word order alternation is possible in a language with otherwise relatively strict word order, such as English, but not in a related langauge such as German, which is otherwise freer in its constituent ordering, allowing, e.g., for scrambling. In this article, the pattern is explained in terms of (the raking of) violable universal constraints from different modules of grammar. I introduce a PVC-related syntactic constraint which punsihes particle pied-piping.

  abstract = {In reported speech, a that-clause depending on a reporting verb in the past tense can under certain conditions use the present tense instead of the past tense: He said that his name was/is John. The conditions in question have often been discussed in the literature (see especially Riddle 1978). The present article concentrates on the factors that hamper or prevent the use of the present tense. Some of these have to do with the fact that a reporting verb creates an intensional domain, others are related to the speaker's choice of 'temporal focus'. All in all, the factors appear to be numerous and of many different types: they have to do with syntax, semantics, pragmatics, communication structure and context. The theoretical relevance of these findings is that they cast doubt on the traditional 'sequence of tense' analysis of reported speech and corroborate the analysis in terms of 'temporal domains' proposed in Declerck (1991).},

This paper analyzes the case system of Nez Perce, a ``three-way ergative'' language, with an eye towards a formalization of the category of transitive subject. I show that it is object agreement that is determinative of transitivity, and hence of ergative case, in Nez Perce. I further show that the transitivity condition on ergative case must be coupled with a criterion of subjecthood that makes reference to participation in subject agreement, not just to origin in a high argument-structural position. These two results suggest a formalization of the transitive subject as that argument uniquely accessing both high and low agreement information, the former through its (agreement-derived) connection with T and the latter through its origin in the specifier of a head associated with object agreement (v). In view of these findings, I argue that ergative case morphology should be analyzed not as the expression of a syntactic primitive but as the morphological spell-out of subject agreement and object agreement on a nominal.},

In spoken French, these are obligatorily realized as dislocated vs. nondislocated noun phrases. The results provide overwhelming evidence for the early mastery of topic, even by the youngest children (2;6). The only difficulty was in the evaluation of fine-grained salience distinctions, leading to the underuse of full noun phrases in ambiguous contexts. A theory of mind test revealed that the ability to assess their listener's knowledge state is not sufficient to explain this underuse. Instead, children's overreliance on the situational context as a source of complementary information to disambiguate their utterances is argued to have a major impact on how explicit they are.},

Differencesbetween bare singulars and plurals in languages without determinersare explained by treating bare nominals as kind terms. Differencesarise, it is argued, because singular and plural kinds relatedifferently to their instantiations. In languages with determiners,singular kinds typically occur with the definite determiner, butplural/mass kinds can be bare in some languages and definite inothers. An account of singular kinds in terms of taxonomic readingsis proposed, with number marking playing a crucial role inexplaining the obligatory presence of the determiner. The variationbetween languages with respect to plural/mass kinds is explained bypositing a universal scale of definiteness, with individual languageschoosing different cut-off points for lexicalization of the definitedeterminer. The possibility of further cross-linguistic variation isalso considered.},

Previous analyses of Korean nasalization and lateralization have accounted for the patterns of altenration by reference to rules of various types and rule ordering, with more recent analyses incorporating feature geometry with underspecificaiton. While some of the previous reserach has indeed noted the importance of syllable contact as a motivating force behind the Korean nasalization and lateralization phenomena, such research has been unable to directly formalize the role that syllable contact plays in Korean phonology. After first presenting the Korean data that highlights the importance of syllabe contact, we develop an optimiality-theoretic analysis of Korean nasalization and laterlization in which SyllCon is an undominated constraint. The high ranking nature of this constraint determines which underlying consonantal sequences undergo altenration. The specific type of alternation (lateralization or nasalization) is determined by the lower ranking constraints. We compare our analysis with previous approaches to the Korean nasalization and lateralization problem found in the literature and argue for the superiority of the optimality-theoretic approach.},

Drawing on both standard and certain new evidence and arguments, it is proposed that V-P constructions generally come in one or both of two varieties: lexical compounds (mess up in mess up the song) and/or discontinuous verbs, that is, lexemes with more than one piece projected as a word or phrase (mess . . . up in mess the song up), and that the alternation, for those that have both manifestations, reflects different argument structure possibilities for a lexemewith the same overall conceptual semantics. The internal structure of VPs built on V-P lexemes is examined in some detail. The popular `small-clause' approach, according to which the DP of transitive V-P structures is the subject of a phrase that has the P as its predicate, is shown to be problematic, primarily because there in fact exists a true small-clause construction that can have a P as its predicate and the putative small clause of cases like mess the song up systematically lacks the defining properties of this construction. The word-order restrictions that the small-clause approach is designed, in part, to account for are shown to follow from a set of independently needed linearization constraints, which are motivated by functional principles.},

Three native speakers were recorded in a sound booth reading thirty-six utterances. Each utterance contained a parenthetical (PA) of variable length, preceded by a noun phrase (NP) and followed by a verb phrase (VP) whose lengths were also varied. Utterances contained only voiced sounds, and the same ratio of high and low vowels. Speakers uttered each Phonological Utterance (PU) as three separate Intonation Phrases (IPs) corresponding to the NPs, PAs, and VPs. The final syllable of each phrase was realized with significantly more lengthening than syllables within the phrase, and pitch was scaled higher at the edges of than within major syntactic phrases. Silent pauses within the PU were optional. If occurred, they were only realized at the edges of PAs. These results support prosodic and non-linear syntactic representations of parentheticals as autonomous phrase structures within the utterance.},

In addition, it is shown that this is not the only strategy in Spanish for conveying narrow focus through intonation, as increased F0 peak height may also be used. While either strategy may be used to convey focus in different positions within an utterance, there is a difference in frequency which is explained based on the ability to counteract downstep in all positions except initial position, where there is no previous peak from which to downstep.},

  abstract = {The majority of studies on Spanish focus have dealt with the way word order is used to convey focus. Recent studies have shown that prosody is also used in marking Spanish focus, though the role of intonation has not been extensively investigated. This paper examines the ways in which intonation is used locally at the focal word to mark contrastive focus in Spanish. It is shown that there are four different intonational patterns that are used in the local marking of contrastive focus, including three patterns differing phonologically from broad focus utterances and one differing phonetically. The phonological marking of focus through intonation involves the use of a focal pitch accent and interme- diate phrase boundary tones, while the phonetic marking involves the use of an expanded pitch range.},

We also present new data from Modern German, illustrating the same syntactic behavior of corresponding arguments in that language. Thus, we conclude that subject-like obliques exhibit behavioral properties of syntactic subjects from the earliest attested Germanic period onwards. Our findings contradict the standard view that these arguments were objects, which gradually acquired subject properties. We show that data from Gothic intended to support the standard view has been misinterpreted. Given the validity of our findings there are no grounds for reconstructing a stage at which subject-like obliques were objects in Germanic.},

While this treatment is well motivated for many adpositions in many languages, there are some which \textendash{} in some of their uses \textendash{} would be better treated as nonhead daughters of verbal or nominal projections. These exceptional adpositions, which I will henceforth call 'minor', are the central topic of the article: I will provide criteria for their identification, propose a detailed treatment of the constructions which contain them, and address the question of whether they orm a natural class. The wider significance of the analysis consists in the evidence which it provides against the wide-spread practice of treating function words as heads of phrasal projections. This practice, which is mainly associated with Chomsky (1986) and which has led to the postulation of a plethora of functional projections, including CP, DetP, and InflP, is not well suited to a treatment of the minor adpositions and should be replaced with an alternative in which thse adpositions are treated as functor daughters in verbal or nominal projections. The analysis draws on various types of descriptive and formal grammar, as well as on corpus-based research, but the format in which it is cast is the contraint-based lexicalist one of Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar; see Pollard and Sag (1994). A brief introduciton to the HPSG notation is provided in section 2.2. The exemplification will be based on Dutch, but at various points comparisons will be made with English and German.},

But subjects with governed CAse cannot delete, so the Chinese equivalents are unambiguous. The same distinction underlies the Chinese/English difference for (e.g.) Everyone recommended abook. English subjects, with agreement Case, allow objects to raise over them at LF; but Chinese subjects, with governed Case, block objects from raising, preventing ambiguity. Evidence for this account comes from correct predictions about amiguity in sentences with double objects or PPs; correlations with ECP phenomena; and the fact that Japanese, Korean, and Persian behave (largely) like Chinese.},

Our experiments show that speakers predict the characteristics ofneutralized segments on the basis ofphonologically similar morphemes stored in the mental lexicon. This effect of the similar morphemes can be modeled in several ways. We compare five models, among them STOCHASTIC OPTIMALITY THEORY and ANALOGICAL MODELING OF LANGUAGE; all perform approximately equally well, but they differ in their complexity, with analogical modeling oflanguage providing the most economical explanation.},

I propose a chain-based scope-marking convention and a new analysis of adjunction, and hypothesize that English is a covert verb-second grammar. The analysis is couched within checking theory and ultimately within the bare theory of phrase structure. I propose category-neutral(-ized) LF representations, displaying VP-recursion but lacking functional heads and their projections, and I suggest that this, in turn, allows significant simplification of index-sensitive head government conditions appearing in many contemporary formulations of the ECP},

  abstract = {Drawing on data from Modern Hebrew, I argue that derived argument-taking nominals do not form an aspectually homogeneous class and that the nominal system manifests a perfective/imperfective opposition. Each aspectual type is characterized by a cluster of different syntactic properties. Concretely, it is shown that imperfective nominals, in contrast to perfective nominals, are non-definite, fail to host subjects, and disallow DP internal agreement. The defective nature of imperfective nominals is hypothesized to derive from the absence of the functional head D intheir projection. The difference in the aspectual interpretation of the two types of argument-taking nominals is also attributed to the presence or absence of D. Teh proposed account of aspect in the nominal system provides a prinicipled explanation for the mass properties of argument-taking nominals, linking the latter to the aspectual non-delimitedness of these nominals.},

  volume = {79},
  abstract = {The semantics of simple (i.e. two-term) systems of demonstratives have in general hitherto been treated as inherently spatial and as marking a symmetrical opposition of distance (`proximal' versus `distal'), assuming the speaker as a point of origin. More complex systems are known to add further distinctions, such as visibility or elevation, but are assumed to build on basic distinctions of distance. Despite their inherently context-dependent nature, little previous work has based the analysis of demonstratives on evidence of their use in real interactional situations. In this article, video recordings of spontaneous interaction among speakers of Lao (Southwestern Tai, Laos) are examined in an analysis of the two Lao demonstrative determiners nii4 and nan4. A hypothesis of minimal encoded semantics is tested against rich contextual information, and the hypothesis is shown to be consistent with the data. Encoded conventional meanings must be kept distinct from contingent contextual information and context-dependent pragmatic implicatures. Based on examples of the two Lao demonstrative determiners in exophoric uses, the following claims are made. The term nii4 is a semantically general demonstrative, lacking specification of ANY spatial property (such as location or distance). The term nan4 specifies that the referent is `not here' (encoding `location' but NOT `distance'). Anchoring the semantic specification in a deictic primitive `here' allows a strictly discrete intensional distinction to be mapped onto an extensional range of endless elasticity. A common `proximal' spatial interpretation for the semantically more general term nii4 arises from the paradigmatic opposition of the two demonstrative determiners. This kind of analysis suggests a reappraisal of our general understanding of the semantics of demonstrative systems universally. To investigate the question in sufficient detail, however, rich contextual data (preferably collected on video) is necessary.},

An alternative approach is proposed for lexical pronouns, where the various classes of pronouns are distinguished according to the licensers and binders they require, and their distribution is determined through the specification of the position of their licensers and binders and the specificaations of the relation that must hold between them.},

  abstract = {Classic problems of how to generalize over predicate-argumetn realtions (e.g., 'buy' vs. 'sell'; 'spray paint' vs. 'spray a wall') have led to postulating semantic representations which are structured differently than deep syntax, such as (linked) theta grids and (lexical) conceptual structures. I argue that such autonomous semantics massively violates parsimony, and that theta-roles are better predicted by using onlyl modestly enhanced, independently justified deep structures. In addition, I claim that several recent generalizations (of Rizzi, Levin and Rappaport, and Randall) are better formulated as deep syntactic properties than in terms of theta-roles. The syntactic approach to predicate-argument relations thus reinitiates a line of research implicit in Chomsky's 'Aspects' but never developed. The first section argues that only this approach faithfully applies to the syntactic revolution to lexical (head-complement) semantics. Principles invoked include Chomsky's Full Interpretation and Rule for Agents and Talmy's Figure/Ground separation, along with a new Ground Specification and syntactic counterparts to two formal devices from Jackendoff's Conceptual Structures. The thematic role constellations for many verb classes (mostly but not all from English) are shown to follow from these principles. The conclusion speculates that the theta-roles assigned to a sentence are not its properties at a linguistic level, but rather indicate how that sentence is to modify cogniitive representations.},

I show that the two perfects occur in essentially the same structure and are distinguished by a difference in movemetn to T; moreover, the difference in forms can be derived without reference to category labels like "verb" or "adjective" on the Root. In addition, the difference in perfects is determined by a feature with clear syntactic consequences, which must be assoicated arbitrarily with certain Roots, the deponent verbs. I discuss the implications of these points in the context of Distributed Morphology, the theory in which the analysis is framed.},

These distinct constructions are shown to have a shared structural subcomponent.

  title = {Blocking {{Effects}} and {{Analytic}}/{{Synthetic Alternations}}},
  volume = {25},
  abstract = {A number of interactions in grammar are referred to as showing blocking effects, typically defined as cases in which the existence of one form prevents the existence of a form that is otherwise expected to occur. Patterns of analytic/synthetic alternation, in which two-word and one-word forms alternate with each other, have been taken to be instances of blocking in this sense. An example is found in the formation of English comparatives and superlatives, where, for example, the synthetic form smarter appears to block the analytic form *more smart. Analytic forms are available in other cases (e.g. more intelligent), such that the interaction between the ``one word'' and ``two word'' forms is crucially at issue. This paper examines English comparative and superlative formation, concentrating on the question of how the morphophonology relates to syntax and semantics. A central point is that in the architecture of Distributed Morphology, these cases do not involve word/word or word/phrase competition- based blocking. Rather, blocking effects broadly construed are reduced to the effects of distinct mechanisms: (1) Vocabulary Insertion at a particular terminal node (morpheme), and (2) the operation of combinatory processes. The paper provides a detailed discussion of the latter type, showing that synthetic comparative/superlative forms are created post-syntactically by affixation under adjacency. Throughout the discussion, questions concerning the status of blocking effects in Distributed Morphology, and those found in analytic/synthetic alternations in particular, play a central role.},

Spanish presents a clear tendency to divide utterances into (S)(VO) phrasings, depending on branchingness. In EP (SVO) is the predominant phrasing, but a long branching subject can trigger the phrasing (S)(VO). The main differences between the two languages are analyzed as arising from two properties: the different syntactic position of subjects (external or internal to Extended VP) and the different parameters of prosodic weight (number of syllables vs. number of words/branchingness) realized by each language. Constraints of the syntax- prosody interface and prosodic constraints on the maximum size of major phrases refer to these properties and produce different outcomes. The preference shared by EP and Spanish to have the material in a VP contained in the same major phrase (disallowing (V)(O) phrasings) also stems from a syntax-phonology constraint.},

There is independent evidence for assimilating pronouns to determiners, and for NP-deletion; so this theory explains E-type anaphora without postulating any special entity ('E-type pronoun') for the purpose. Since NP-deletion, like other ellipsis, requires an antecedent, this theory also explains the requirement for a "formal link" between donkey pronoun and antecedent, which standard E-type theories find difficult to account for. Other empirical advantages of this thoery include its ability to explain the pattern of strict and sloppy identity displayed by donkey sentences with phonologically reduced continuations. It is shown that Bach-Peters sentences, quantificational subordination, and paycheck sentences can also be dealt with ont eh present account.},

This feature triggers movement of a delimiting argument to the specifier of AspP for checking reasons. Also, it is assumed that a predicate needs a subject and that the specifier of ASp counts as subject of the predicate from which Asp has been projected. If affectedness constructions are distinguished by the fact taht their external argument is missing, having been lexically oppressed, it follows that a derivation converges iff an internal argument can be promoted to subject position; externalization of the internal arguemnt can be promoted to subject position; externalization of the internal argument can be driven only by delimited predicates, because only a delimiting object can be triggered to move to the specifier of Asp [+delimited]. The article concentrates on an affectedness construction in Swedish: have of possession+DP+passive particple.

  abstract = {This paper presents a Relational Grammar analysis of the Polish Object Control Construction (OCC) and considers the viability of clause reduction as a universal analysis of reduced constructions. Polish OCC sentences parallel Romance reduced sentences in exhibiting both monoclausal and biclausal characteristics. To the extent that the OCC and reduced constructions in other languges are a reflex of a singly phenomenon, the Polish data demonstrate that any successful universal analysis should be general enough to allow for simultaneous mono- and biclausal effects. Since Polish and Romance reduced constructions show similar syntactic effects and since analyses which appeal to morphology or place strong emphasis on word order do not extend to the OCC, the Polish data argue that an analysis which is independent of surface expression is more explanatory.},

Instead of using existing vocabulary-based methods, which cannot be applied to these languages due to the paucity of shared lexemes, we created a database of STRUCTURAL FEATURES\textemdash{}abstract phonological and grammatical features apart from their form. The methods are first tested on the closely related Oceanic languages spoken in the same region as the Papuan languages in question. We find that using biological methods on structural features can recapitulate the results of the comparative method tree for the Oceanic languages, thus showing that structural features can be a valid way of extracting linguistic history. Application of the same methods to the otherwise unrelatable Papuan languages is therefore likely to be similarly valid. Because languages that have been in contact for protracted periods may also converge, we outline additional methods for distinguishing convergence from inherited relatedness.},

It focuses on post-verbal null subjects in finite clauses, here termed Rogues. It is argued that hte statistically significant presence of Rogues, in conjunciton with their distinct developmental profile, speaks against a Strong Continuity approach to the acquisition of null subject knowledge in German, and urges a reconsidertaiton of the notion of Optionality in early grammars. The signifcance of the Rogues stage is considered in teh context of specific theoretical proposals about argument omission: those of Rizzi (1992; 1994; 200), and of Wexler (1994; 1998), are contrased with the Weak Continuity approach proposed by Clahsen and his associates (e.g., Slahsen (1990/1991), Clahsen and Penke (1992), Clahsen, Eisenbeiss, and Penke (1996)). The data presented here, which complement related work by Hamann (1996), provide additional empirical support for these latter hypotheses.},

The Chichewa facts recall observations made concerning the differences between English adjectival and verbal passives, first formalized in Wasow 1977, but provide more straightforward evidence for a distinction, due to the absence of surface homophony. The paper concludes by reconsidering English adjectival and verbal passive constructions, and showing them to be morphologically distinct.},

I examine a typical case of cyclicity, namely, stress in Shanghai compounds, where the layers of embedding are in principle unlimited. I show that alignment constraints are inadequate. Instead, identity constraints are needed, in particular Stress-ID which requires that stress locations in the immediate constituents of a compound be the same as when the constituents occur alone. In addition, Stress-ID (and other constraints) must be checked recursively, namely, at every layer of syntactic bracketing. This analysis incorporates the essential properties of the cycle and can therefore handle all cyclic cases. Finally, I discuss the compatibility of recursive constraint evaluation with parallelism, and the remaining differences between a cyclic analysis and recursive constraint evaluation.},

The main claim of the article is that the majority of no constructions in early child English are determiner phrases (DPs) in which no appears as a determiner. This claim is supported on the basis of distributional and morphosyntactic tests, a discourse analysis of children's elliptical negatives, and a comparison of no constructions in child and adult English. These results suggest that the Sentence Operator analysis, the standard analysis of child English no for more than 30 years, is untenable as a general analysis of child English no. The results also suggest that although children make many mistakes using no, they represent no as a determiner in abstract syntax and control the Phonetic Form principles that regulate the use of discourse ellipsis with no DPs at a very early age.},

Cues are local, and there is no global fitness metric (contra Clark and Roberts 1993).

These exceptional properties are clearly linked to the relative ill-formedness of onsetless syllables, but previous analyses do not formalize this correlation in a way that generalizes straightforwardly to all cases of exceptional prosody. I argue in this paper that the theory of Generalized Alignment (McCarthy and Prince 1993a,b), developed within Optimality Theory, provides us with a unified way of accounting for onsetless syllable exceptionality. By constraining the domains for phonological processes to optimally begin with optimal syllables, the exceptional prosody of onsetless syllables can uniformly be analyzed as prosodically motivated constituent misalignment.},

  abstract = {Semitic templates systematically encode two dimensions of verb meaning: (a) $\backslash$emphagency, the thematic role of the verb's external argument, and (b) $\backslash$emphvoice. The assumption that this form-meaning correspondence is mediated by syntax allows the parallel compositional construction of the form and the meaning of a verb from teh forms and the meanings of its root and template. The root and its arguments are optionally embedded under a light verb v which introduces the agent (Hale and Keyser 1993; Kratzer 1994). but this is only the unmarked case, which, in Semitic, is encoded by the $\backslash$emphsimple templates. Two dinensions of markedness are introduced by two addtional types of syntactic heads: (a) $\backslash$emphagency heads, which modify agnecy and are morphologically realized as the $\backslash$emphintensive and $\backslash$emphcausative etmplates, and (b) $\backslash$emphvoice heads, which modify voice and are morphologically realized as the $\backslash$emphpassive and $\backslash$emphmiddle templates. Causative and middle moprhemes are thus accounted for within a unified system, which, first explains their affinity in language in general (both are found crosslinguisticslly as markers of trnasitivey alternations), and which, moreover, sheds new light on problems in the interface of semantics and morphology. One problem is the impossibility, mostly ignored int he linguistic theory, of deriving the sematnics of middle verbs from that of the corresponding transitive verbs. The secon dis explaining the identity found crosslinguistically between middle and refelxive moephology. The third is determining the grammatical function of the causee in causative constructions.},

To date, symmetry of this sort has been identified only in a small geographically contiguous group of Bantu languages. Bajau, an Austronesian language of Indonesia and the Philippines, is shown to be symmetrical. Unlike the Bantu languges previously described, Bajau permits a benefactive applied object to be treated like an ordinary direct object. The restriction on the extraction of benefactive applied objects must therefore not be universal, contrary to the assumption of previous theories.},

  title = {Categoriality and {{Object Extraction}} in {{Cantonese Serial Verb Constructions}}},
  volume = {24},
  abstract = {The Cantonese `coverb' construction, a serial verb construction in which the first verb (the `coverb') has a preposition-like meaning and function, presents a challenge for theories of wh-dependencies and island constraints. Coverbs resist extraction of their objects by topicalization or relativization, a fact which has often been explained in terms of a preposition-stranding constraint in accounts of similar facts in Mandarin. However, Cantonese coverbs display the morphosyntactic properties of verbs, suggesting that they cannot be prepositions. In this paper, we propose that coverbs are verbs, and that the relevant extraction constraint is a kind of adjunct island constraint. This proposal is supported with experimental evidence from a sentence judgment task. Two key findings are as follows: (1) listeners judged extraction from a coverb phrase as significantly less acceptable than extraction from a simple clause; (2) listeners judged sentences both with and without aspectual marking (verbal morphosyntax) on the coverb as highly acceptable. Together, these findings support our proposal that coverbs are verbs (not prepositions) and that coverb phrases form a kind of adjunct island. However, we show that existing adjunct island conditions (such as the CED) are not adequate to account for our data. Following Hawkins' (1999) processing-based theory of filler-gap dependencies, we propose a simple, languagespecific formulation of the extraction constraint, and we argue that this constraint is more generally motivated by a processing principle called Avoid Competing Subcategorizers \textendash{} one of the same principles that motivates preposition-stranding constraints in other languages. Thus, although object extraction is prohibited by a kind of adjunct island constraint, the function of the constraint in processing efficiency is similar to that of a preposition-stranding constraint.},

The conclusions reached are these (1) Scope reconstruction is represented in the syntax (semantic type-shifting operations are very limited). (2) A'-chains have the following properties: (a) Scope reconstruction results from deleting the head of the chain and interpreting the head of the chain with a copy of the restrictor at the tail (unless this option is impossible, as in antecedent-contained deletion, in which case the copy is changed to a variable as in standard notations). (c) VP adjunction is an intermediate landing site. (3) A-chains are different in a way that at the moment requires a stipulative distinction.},

Focus was on the phonetic variants used for (t) in word-medial and word-final prevocalic contexts since it is known that these variants display clear sociolinguistic patterning in the adult community. Variant usage in CDS was found to differ markedly from that in interadult speech. Effects were also found with respect to the age and gender of the children being addressed. Speech to girls generally contained more standard variants than speech to boys, which, by contrast, contained higher rates of vernacular variants. The differentiation by gender was most apparent for the youngest children. The findings are assessed in comparison to other studies of CDS. It has previously been claimed that modifications made in the CDS register help children to learn linguistic structures and also to learn that speech is a social activity. Our findings suggest that CDS may play an additional role, providing boys and girls as young as 2;0 with differential opportunities to learn the social-indexical values of sociolinguistic variables.},

The syntactic and semantic characteristics of these complements account straightforwardly for well-known differences between FI and FP, including the previously untreated ``obligation'' requirement in FI, absent in FP. Our analysis also accounts for another subtle restriction on the formation of FP: the existence of an animacy requirement on the subject of fare, absent in FI. Finally, we argue that only FP can undergo passivization; this accounts for a previously unobserved asymmetry in passivizability of causatives of unergative and unaccusative intransitive verbs.},

I propose instead a deterministic device that waits for unambiguous triggers to set parameters. This learner must be able to detect parametric ambiguity. This is not possible on the classical conception of triggers as sentences that flip parameter switches. It is possible if a trigger (and the parameter value it triggers is a piece of tree structure, perhaps a single feature, made available by Universal Grammar, and adopted into the learner's grammar if input sentences cannot be parsed without it.},

  abstract = {Several distinct approaches to the locality of movement have emerged within the Minimalist Program, but little attention has been paid to their formal and empirical differences. I examine a range of possible locality constraints on movement that are representative of current approaches. I expose some important formal differences among these alternatives and examine five phenomena, some previously unnoted, that distinguish them empirically. No single approach succeeds in capturing all of the facts that should arguably follow from a theory of locality, but the bulk of the evidence seems to support a theory that defines locality using only simple and independently motivated syntactic objects and relations.},

  volume = {24},
  abstract = {What appears to be deletion is, in some cases, the result of syntactic movement out of a phonologically and. semantically interpreted domain. Support for this conclusion comes from a phenomenon of question truncation that I call auxdrop. I show that aux-drop questions differ minimally from full questions in that their auxiliary, though present early in the derivation, moves to a position in which it is interpreted neither phonologically nor semantically. I also argue that this deletion through movement is not subject to a recoverability condition. The analysis finds a natural place in a theory where head movement is syntactic (not purely phonological) and spell-out is cyclic. This approach explains the emergence of the factative effect \textendash{} a type of tense interpretation pattern found in ``bare sentences'' in, e.g., Haitian Creole and F cngbe` \textendash{} in an obscure corner of certain languages that normally require full tense specification in finite clauses. My approach finds further support in the patterning of aux-drop questions with VP topicalization and pseudoclefts with respect to morphological mismatch, a pattern of verbal perfect interpretation in the absence of participial morphology.},

  title = {Optimal {{Binding}}},
  volume = {22},
  abstract = {According to Chomsky's Binding Theory (cf. Chomsky 1981), the distribution of anaphors, pronouns, and R-expressions is regulated by three principles: Principle A, B, and C. Although the predictions of these principles are very often borne out, they cannot account for phenomena likek long distance anaphors, the difference between different types of anaphors, data where anaphors and pronouns are not in complementary distribution, or languages like Vietnamese in whihc R-expressions may be bound. The aim of this paper is therefore to develop a theory of binding which captures these phenomena. Based on a close analysis of Englihs, German, dutch, Italian, and Icelandic, I show that these apprent exceptions can easily be intergrated into a uniform theory of binding it if is assumed that the principles that regulate bidnign are violable. Thus I will present an optimality-theoretic analysis that makes it possible to account for the occurrence of simplex anaphors, complex anaphors, pronouns, and R-expression in a uniform and straightforward way. The approach is based on the interaction of two universal constraint hierarchies. One of them takes into account the fact that biding is sensitive to domains of different size; the other one prohibits elements of different anaphoric degree. On the bases of these two constraint hierarchies, the competition selects the optimal element in a given context.},

The constructions behave differently with respect to weak crossover, the occurrence of overt complementizers and agreement affixes, and word order. I argue that these difference follow from the hypothesis that the gap in one wh-construction is formed by cyclic movement while the other construction involves simple binding between an A' (non-argument) position and a null resumptive element in an A (argument) position. The resumptive A' dependency, however, also displays some surprising movement diagnostics, and so I argue that a wh-operator enters derivation in A' position, binds the A position, and then undergoes movement to its overt position. The analysis also involves the postulation of a Specifier position below C' where focus features are checked. Arguments are presented tha tthis position is an A' position, and that it creates an island for other cyclic movement. In addition, the extraction patterns highlight the role of agreement features on functional heads, in particular C, and the different ways in which they may be checked.},

  volume = {11},
  abstract = {The distribution of the particle -wa in Japanese sentences depends to a very signifi- cant extent on which speech act those sentences are used to perform. In an Austinian theory of assertive speech acts, four types of assertive speech act are distinguished. It is argued here that the dimensions along which the structures of these speech acts vary are the dimensions that serve to explain the presence of -wa. Furthermore, the various uses of -wathat have been identified in the literature, including the thematic and contrastive uses, are brought under a unified system. There are, however, two more general themes that are addressed here. First, it is claimed that, once a principled theory of speech acts is in play, the relative contributions of syntax and semantics to the study of natural language become more easy to distinguish. This provides an antidote to the tendency to syntacticize problems that are properly pragmatic (or pragmaticize problems that are properly syntactic, etc.). The attempt is made to separate these domains without favor. The other theme involves Austin's account of predication in terms of matching types of items and senses of predicates. That proposal, which stands in contrast to common assumptions in the semantics literature, and which is central to his account of assertive speech acts, deserves attention},

The verbs suceder, ocurrir, `to happen', as well as meteorological verbs, belong to the second class. Data regarding word order, idiom formation, existential interpretation, raising, extraction from coordinate structures, and nominalization show that with these impersonal predicates the locative/dative PPs behave as real subjects, and contrast with those which appear in locative-inversion constructions, which involve anteposition of an internal argument.

This paper proposes that these two notable OV orders in EAC are structurally distinct and that the structure of [wh V] is also different fromthat of [wh Neg/Aux V]. Furthermore, it is argued that Proto-Chinese is an SOV language and that the change from SOV (Proto-Chinese) to SVO (EAC) caused a stress shift from preverbal to postverbal position. According to the theory developed here, some problems that have remained in the syntax of Classical Chinese cease to exist, including the following: Why did the two OV structures remain in EAC? Why did the [wh-object V] order disappear later than the [Neg Pro-object V] order? Why did monosyllabic wh-words (e.g., he 'what') but not disyllabic wh-expressions (e.g., he-shi 'what thing') immediately precede the verb? And why was the disappearance of the [wh-object V] structure followed by a development of disyllabic wh-words (e.g., he wu 'what thing' $>$ hewu 'what')? Each of these questions is answered in terms of prosody. The arguments made here claim that prosody is very important in resolving questions of how changes take place.},

Minimalist inquiries: the framework. MIT Occasional Papers in Linguistics 15. MITWPL, Cambridge, MA) phase-based approach to syntactic derivation. Wh-copying is traditionally thought to provide strong evidence for the successive-cyclic nature of wh-movement. Besides the more general problem of how intermediate movement steps are formally triggered, however, the wh-copying phenomenon raises the questions of what grammatical condition or conditions should permit (or possibly, force) the phonetic realisation of intermediate wh-copies, why the spelling-out of locally uninterpretable copies of a wh-operator does not cause the derivation to crash at the phase level, and to what extent their presence poses a problem for the principle of Full Interpretation and for Kayne's (Kayne, R., 1994. The Antisymmetry of Syntax. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA) Linear Correspondence Axiom. It is shown that an analysis of wh-copying in terms of the discontinuous spelling-out of a wh-expression's `operator' and `core' parts, in conjunction with a convergence-based view of phases, not only helps provide answers to the above questions, but also accounts for some otherwise difficult-to-explain restrictions on wh-copying.},

In this paper we challenge this claim by means of an elicitation experiment carried out with children acquiring two closely related languages, Catalan and Spanish. Our results show that while omission is high in young Catalan-speaking children, it is very low in Spanish-speaking children. We argue that this difference can be attributed to a property of their respective grammars (the presence or otherwise of past participle agreement when objects cliticize) under the Unique Checking Constraint of Wexler (1998). In a second experiment, we confirm the robustness of early sensitivity to past participle agreement; through a grammaticality judgment task we find a statistically significant difference between the two languages. We show that the parametric approach postulated can be extended, for mandatory, overt objects, beyond Catalan and Spanish, broadening the empirical scope of the Unique Checking Constraint.},

Our proposal differs from previous analyses (Hansson 2001; Rose and Walker 2004) in that only total identity is a non-local phenomenon. While non-adjacent consonants may interact via a relation we call linking, the only requirement which may be placed on linked consonants is total identity. All single feature identities are the result of local spreading. The interaction of a total identity requirement on ejectives and stri- dents with anteriority harmony in Chol (Mayan) highlights the distinction between these two types of long-distance phenomena. We show that theories that allow non- local, single-feature agreement make undesirable predictions, and that the more restrictive typology predicted by our framework is supported by the vast majority of long-distance assimilation cases.},

Previous analyses of EPs are shown to fail to solve these puzzles. A new unified solution to the two puzzles is proposed. The crucial insight of the analysis is to allow von Fintel's (Natural Language Semantics 1: 123\textendash{}148, 1993; Restrictions on quantifier domains, PhD dissertation, 1994) leastness condition on EPs to be imposed at scopes non-local to the surface position of the EP. A general result is derived concerning the truth conditions of sentences in which an existential modified by an EP occurs in the scope of a downward entailing operator. The distribution of EPs is argued to depend on how the leastness condition interacts with other pragmatic strengthening conditions, such as the one imposed on any by Kadmon and Landman (Linguistics and Philosophy 16: 353\textendash{}422, 1993).},

This tendency has been cited in support of the claim that probabilities are an inherent part of grammar, and of syntax in particular. There is widespread consensus, however, that the syntax of natural languages cannot be captured in terms of item-to-item transitions (Chomsky 1957). Therefore, unless one considers probabilities of syntactic structures, rather than particular combinations of neighboring words, pronunciation variation cannot be said to reflect probabilistic effects in syntax. In this article we report a case of pronunciation variation that reflects contextual probabilites of syntactic structures. The relevant probabilities are based on the probability of a given syntactic structure, given a particular verb. We show that these probabiliteis affect American English /t,d/-deletion, as well as the durations of words and phrases. Our results are consistent with the notion that knowledge of grammar includes knowledge of probabilites of syntactic structures, and that this knowledge affects language production.},

The effect of lemma frequency persisted when local speaking rate, predictability from neighboring words, position relative to pauses, syntactic category, and orthographic regularity were brought under statistical control.

  abstract = {Past theoretical analyses have claimed that some languages employ a special type of phonological spreading of a consonantal over a vowel, long-distance consonantal spreading. I argue that this type of spreading can and must be eliminated from the theory, by reducing it to segmental copying as in reduplication. This elimination is first motivated from a number of perspectives, including considerations of locality and theoretical redundancy. The reduction to reduplication is then developed in detail for Temiar, one of the main indigenous languages of Malayasia, notorious for the complexity of its copying patterns. Crucial to this reduction is the notion of gradient violation of constraints in Optimality Theory (Prince and Smolensky 1993), and the notion of correspondence, with its particular application to reduplication (McCarthy and Prince 1995a). The proposal extends to other languages (e.g. Arabic, Chaha, Modern Hebrew, and Yoruba), where the putative spreading had been thought necessary. The elimination of long-distance consonantal spreading is aruged to further obviate two other special mechanisms, also thought to apply ona language-particular basis: (a) the representation that segregates vowels and consonants on different planes, known as V/C planar segregation, and (b) the distinct mode of word formation consisting of mapping segments to templates},

The results of an interpretation task suggest that Chinese learners cannot extend beyond the properties of the L1. However, these results are interpreted in light of a series of related studies that show that Chinese learners can acquire tense and aspect in L2 English and that English native speakers also have difficulty with the imperfective in L2 Japanese. We argue that difficulty with the interpretation of imperfectives in L2 acquisition is not related solely to the properties of the L1, but rather to two properties of the target language: the specific morphological encoding of tense and aspect and the complexity of the semantic computation.},

Their syntactic behavior will be accounted for by a paratactic analysis. IV2 can only modify wide scope indefinites inside what looks like hte matrix clause. This is captured at the level of DRS construction. Since the matrix clause alone doesn't constitute a complete informational unit, IV2 can be introduced as a condition into the matrix DRS before evaluation. The weak demonstrative of IV2 establishes the relative link by copying a top-level discourse marker. In addition, the assertional nature of IV2 prevents it from modifying definite descriptions. Reference is made to the close relatedness of demonstrative and relative pronoun sin Indo-European. Dutch, Swedish, and Zurich German provide the comparative horizon of this study.

The particle no functions as a clause-linker introducing an adverbial clause. It is shown that a neo-Davidsonian semantics assimilating FNCs to TNCs can be developed. Among the attractive consequences of this is the possibility of giving pre-no quantifiers a standard (non predicative) semantics. The clause combining approach also squares well with the finding that the ``focusing'' nature of FNCs is less regular than often assumed. In particular, non-backgrounded (non-``presupposed'') no-clauses can be found. Among the drawbacks of a clause combining approach is its apparent inability to properly constrain ``binding'' relations between the two clauses. In particular, locality restrictions typical for movement relations are unpredicted. The paper discusses these features in some detail against the backdrop of rivaling movement and pseudocleft approaches. My hope is that it helps in clarifying their strengths and weaknesses. Also, I show that formal semantics is a useful, hitherto often neglected, tool with some potential of furthering our understanding the nature of Malagasy FNCs.},

Therefore, we claim that in these contexts, variation in the placement of the finite verb has to be attributed to competing grammars that differ with respect to parameter settings associated with the functional head v (contra the Double Bse Hypothesis, Pintzuk 1999). Moreover, the proposed analysis provides a principled account for the intriguing fact that a certain serialisation pattern (S-V-O-Vfin) is absent from the variety of ordering possibilities encountered in Old English. It is further argued that our account opens up a new perspective on a set of syntactic factors whcih can be shown to have a statistically significant influence on the position of the finite verb in embedded clauses.},

We argue that the notion of topic as used in the Hungarian literature poses some serious problems, which can only be eliminated if the pragmatic aspects of topichood are separated from its semantic function entailing the development of a two-level approach to information structure. Topic and logical subject belong to two different levels with topic being an essentially pragmatic no- tion and logical subject being a syntactico-semantic notion. On this analysis the basic syntactic structure of the Hungarian sentence is determined by the articulation ``logical subject\textendash{}logical predicate'' rather than by the articulation ``topic-comment''.

Fukui (1995)), with a special focus on the nature and role of linear order and functional categories. A hypothesis called the "Symmetry of Derivation" is put forth, according to which the computations in the overt syntax (i.e., the pre-Spell-Out computations) and the computations in the (pre-Morphology) phonological component are "symmetric" in the sense that they form mirror images of each other. More specifically, we propose that language computation maps an array of linguistic elements to an interface representation in such a way that it starts with a lexical item (a head) proceeding in a bottom-up fashion (Merge) and at some point of this step-by-step derivational process (Spell-Out) starts "decomposing" the structures already formed in a top-down fashion ("Demerge") until the derivation reaches a completely unstructured sequence with a fixed linear order. It is shown that this symmetry principle explains the major properties of phrsae structure in an elegant way. The principle accounts for the apparently universal "leftness" property of Spec in a straightforward way by attributing its leftness to the top-down computation Demerge encounters. With respect to the order between head and its complement, wich allows for cross-linguistic variation (head-initial vs. head-last), the symmetry principle predicts that the head-last order is derived by movement, in clear contrast with Kayne's (1994) approach. The difference between head-initial English adn head-last Japanese is, then, attributed to different propoerties of "light verb" v (Chomsky (1995b)): v has the property of attracting V in English but not in Japanese. Numerous theoretical and empirical consequences are shown to follow in an interesting way from this hypothesis, coupled with the symmetry principle of derivations.},

This view contrasts with analyses of process nominals as (pure) nominals with partial verbal properties, originally due to Chomsky (1970). Contributing to this debate, we will argue that direct evidence indicates that English process nominals contain a VP. Our evidence comes from the ditribution of adverbs on the one hand, and from the presence of the VP anaphor do so in process nominals on the other. We show that a portion of the verbal extended projection specifically excluding IP or CP is present in process nominals. An array of word order facts about process nominals falls into place when we further assume that hte verb is raised from VP over the subject, the object, and adverbs, adjoing to a nominal affix. Our analysis moreover adds to the evidence for functional structure above VP and supports particular claims about the syntax-morphology interface.},

In agreement with recent proposals for other languages, this paper presents an account of Portuguese rhythm based on acoustic measures of consonantal and vocalic intervals, and explores the relation between these measures and the phonological properties specific to the European and Brazilian varieties (EP and BP). The approach followed is both successful in providing evidence for the rhythmic distinction between the two varieties and in relating it to the traditional rhythm typology. Overall, the results show that EP and BP have clearly distinct mixed rhythms: stress- and syllable-timing characterise EP, whereas syllable and moratiming characterise BP. The data further suggest that mixed rhythm is not equivalent to intermediate rhythm, thus supporting the notion of rhythmic classes against the scattering of languages along a rhythmic continuum.},

Specifically,t he I-boundary tone bears the utterace type distinguishing funciton (declarative Li vs. interrogative LH/Hli), while the bitonal nuclear tone carries the focus marker (broad focus H+L* vs. narrow focus H*+L?L*+H).

  volume = {22},
  abstract = {It has long been known that verbal roots containing homorganic consonant pairs are rare in Arabic, motivating the existence of an OCP-Place constraint (Obligatory Contour Principle on place of articulation) in the phonological grammar. We explore this constraint using an on-line lexicon of Arabic roots. The strength of the constraint is quantified by the ratio of the observed number of example of each consonant pair to the number that would be statistically expected under random combination of phonemes. We show that the srength of the effect over all pairs is a gradient funciton of the similarity of the consonants in the pair. A similarity metric based on natural classes is developed, whcih solves the formal difficulties of contrastive underspecification theory while preserving the insight that contrastiveness plays an important role in perceived similarity. Thsi metric is applied in an explicit model of the gradient OCP constraint, which achieves a better fit to the regularities and sub-regularities of the Arabic verbal lexicon than any prior approach. Lastly, we review evidence for the psychological reality of the constraint, for its existence in related forms in other languages, and for its cognitive/phonetic foundations in the speech processing system. We argue that the total body of evidence supports a model in which phonetic and cognitive pressures incrementally affect the lexicon, and phonotactic constraints are abstractions over the lexicon of phonological forms.},

  volume = {18},
  abstract = {In Hebrew, European Portuguese, Palestinian Arabic, and Spanish, both SV and VS orders are possible. However, when children acquire these languages, they do not use the whole array of word orders in their language at the first stage of sentence construction. Interestingly, their word order preference in the early stage of acquisition differs in the different languages: in Hebrew and European Portuguese they use both SV and VS orders with unaccusative verbs, but only SV with unergative and transitive verbs. In Spanish and Palestinian Arabic, children prefer to use VS order with unaccusative, unergative, and transitive verbs in the first stage. We present 11 experiments and 5 spontaneous speech analyses in the four languages, eliciting these word order patterns in 257 different children, and analyzing the patterns in spontaneous speech in 80 more children. Based on these results we propose an account for these cross-linguistic differences and similarities, according to which children at this stage can already move the verb to I, but cannot move the subject outside of the VP yet. As a result, at this stage the subjects stay within the VP. Whether or not the verb moves to I depends on whether the linear order of SV within the VP can be violated\textemdash{}languages in which children assume IP as the Spell-out domain, Spanish and Palestinian Arabic, allow the verb to appear before the subject, whereas Hebrew and European Portuguese, in which the Spell-out domain is initially taken to be VP, do not allow the verb to move to I until the Spell-out domain widens.},

We present evidence supporting the hypothesis and tentatively attribute the effects to sharing of the sturcture of hte antecedent constituent, with structure building or substitution of a variable for a constituent permitted if it is licensed by the syntactic principles of the language. Another set of studies tests the hypothesis that a new utterance is preferentially related to the main assertion of the preceding utterace, which is typically a constituent high in the syntactic tree. Teh results suggest that discourse processing differs from syntacic processing, where the most accessible material is recent material found low int he synatctic tree. A final set of studies examines the interplay of the syntactic processor, which may not violate "islands," and the discourse processor, whch may, in the processing of ellipsis sentences involving islands. A novel explanation is offered for the observation (Ross 1967) that slucing out of relative clause islands is grammatical except when sprouting is required.},

This paper deals specifically with the prosodic domain of Focus in Italian. Building on the theory of Prosodic Phonology, as presented by Selkirk (1984), Nespor and Vogel (1986), this paper provides evidence for the influence of Focus in the applicaiton of phonological rules in Italian and proposes a theory for deriving prosodic constituency in broad as well as narrow Focus sentences. On the basis of the examined data, the problem of main prominence assignment is also dealt with, proposing a "prosodically revised" version of Cinque's (1993) Null Theory. Finally, prosodic data is examined for the syntactici information that it triggers (syntaictic structure is hte input for prosodic mapping rules). Thus, the inclusion of Focus in the feature-checking mechanism will be proposed. Focus information is encoded in a strong feature, which causes the derivaiton to have specific properties prior to the interface level. The paper concludes by showign that the computational system seems to operate homogeneously with all kinds of Focus constructions, providing a spell out structure which, after prosodic mapping, allows Focus to be interpreted at .},

In a cartographic approach to discourse functions, this is identified with the Aboutness-shift Topic (Frascarelli and Hinterh\"olzl 2007) that is merged in the C-domain and is endowed with the edge feature [+aboutness] \textendash{} an `extended EPP feature'. A Topic Criterion is thus proposed that correlates core grammar with discourse requirements and accounts for the syntactic identification of a referential pro.

Macedonian provides crucial evidence that only the former interpretation is viable for the Non-Exhaustiveness Condition, while the Peripherality Condition pertains necessarily to visibility. Fixed antepenultimate stress in this language is analyzed as the final extrametricality variant of penultimate stress. A consideration of stress domains consisiting of several words reveals that a phrase-final monosyllabic word unexpectedly induces penultimate stress. It is argued that this $\backslash$emphMonosyllabic Head Effect results from applying Final Extrametricality lexically, but Constituent Construction postlexically. The final syllable remains extrametrical even though it no longer exhausts the stress domain; internal extrametrical syllables, on the other hand, may be stressed. This treatment of Macedonian supports the compositional analysis of antepenultimate stress and clarifies the nature of the Non-Exhaustiveness and Peripherality Conditions.},

This perspective turns out to restrict the range of possible syntactic structires in a lingusitically natural way, deriving restrictions on possible configurations that must otherwise be stipulated. Furthermore, we show that a primitive c-command view of syntactic structure provides the basis for a radically simplified conception of adjunction structure, one that not only allows us to understand why the adjuncitons operation exists alongside subsitition, but also explain why these operations have their distinctive structural and derivational properties.},

Its set of kinship terms presents an opportunity to investigate the categories constituting their underlying semantic nature, which in turn can be described formally in terms of the interrelated processes of base generation of underlying forms and lexical attachment of the kinship terms to yield the surface forms. The principle of disjunctive lexical sttachment of the terms with respect to their underlying categorial specifications affords an elegant characterization of meaning whereby each term has one such specification for all its apparently varied surface meanings. The universal validity of this and other principles is suggested.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we argue that there are more kinds of relative clause constructions between the linguistic heaven and earth than are dreamed of in the classical lore, which distinguishes just restrictive relative clauses and appositives. We start with degree relatives. Degree, or amount, relatives show restrictions in the relativizers they allow, in the determiners that can combine with them, and in their stacking possibilities. To account for these facts, we propose an analysis with two central, and novel, features: First, we argue that the standard notion of degree (a number on a measuring scale) needs to be replaced by a notion of structured degree, which keeps track of the object measured. Second, we argue that at the CP-level of degree relatives an operation of (degree) maximalization takes place. We show that the observed facts concerning degree relatives follow from these assumptions. We then broaden the discussion to other relative clause constructions. We propose that the operation of maximalization takes place in relative clauses when the head noun is semantically interpreted CP-internally, while syntactically the CP is part of a DP that also contains CP-external material. Based on this, we argue that degree relatives form part of a linguistically coherent class of relative clause constructions \textendash{} we call them maximalizing relatives \textendash{} which all show restrictions similar to those observed for degree relatives, and which differ semantically (and often also syntactically) both from restrictive relative clauses and from appositives. We discuss free relatives, internally-headed relatives, and correlatives.},

We show that, under full preservation of Bhatt and Pancheva's theoretical assumptions, their account faces at least three problems: (a) one of the phenomena they propose to unify, the one involving scope effects, does not exist; (b) (non)conservativity is irrelevant to obligatory extraposition effects; and (c) contrary to their tacit assumption, Trace Conversion is at most an optional procedure for DegP chains. We propose an alternative, nonsemantic treatment of obligatory extraposition effects, which subsumes them under an independently needed adjacency constraint on prehead modifiers. Furthermore, we note that the facts brought up here and in Bhatt and Pancheva 2004 call into question the quantificational approach to degree constructions.},

Children are not corrected for speaking ungrammatically, so how do they avoid overgeneralizing? The 'conservatism'' hypothesis proposes that children do not generalize at all; the 'criteria' hypothesis holds that children learn to constrain their rule to apply to monosyllabic verbs denoting possession changes. In a questionnaire study, adults rated double-object forms with novel verbs as sounding etter if they met these criteria. In an analysis of speech transcripts, children were found to produce ungrammatical double-object sentences (though not very frequently). In two experiments children were taught novel motion verbsl they extended them to double-object structures, and did so more often for monomsyllabic than for polysyllabic verbs and more often to denote a possession transfer than motion to a location. However, children also had a bias to use each verb in the construction they heard it in. Thus children are not invariably conservative but show conservative tendencies, and their generalizations are influenced by morphophonological and semantic criteria. We propose that speakers acquire a dative rule that operates on two levels: a broad-range rule defines the possiblity of a verb menaing 'cause to move' to be changed into one meaning 'cause to have, and narrow-range rules license such extensions to be made for subclasses of semantically and morphologically similar verbs.},

Anti-locality is formulated through a tripartite split of clause structure into Prolific Domains, subdomains of the derivation relevant for the operation Spell-Out. The focus of the investigation will be generalized successive-cyclic movement: clause-internal movement from thematic to A- to A0-positions as well as movement across clause boundaries, thereby unifying the derivational steps involved in unrelated constructions. I argue that, within a clause, an element can only ever move to the next higher Prolific Domain (Intraclausal Movement Generalization), whereas movement across clauses targets a position within the next higher Prolific Domain of the same type (Interclausal Movement Generalization). These two generalizations are claimed to boil down to an interaction between standard locality and anti-locality considerations. Consequently, we can observe a transparent symmetry in locality issues, which I take to be a desirable result.},

This is so because the patients failed to comprehend properly verbal passives and structures involving Wh-movement, but succeeded in tasks that required the proper comprehension of lexical passive. Grammatical theories in which such a performance pattern can be readily described\textendash{} namely, theories that allow for generalizations such as Move-alpha\textendash{} pass a test of psychological reality in that they are compatible with patterns of language breakdown observed following brain damage.

  abstract = {In this study, we investigate whether specific language impairment (SLI) manifests itself grammatically in the same way in Spanish and English with respect to nominal plural marking. English-speaking children with SLI are very proficient at marking plural on nouns. Spanish has two main nominal plural allomorphs: /s/ and /es/. The /es/ allomorph has received multiple theoretical treatments, including one (e.g., Harris (1991)) which argues that in singular-plural pairs such as flor-flores, the /e/ is epenthetic, while other accounts (e.g., Colina (2003)) argue that synchronically there is an underlying /e/ in the singular form (e.g., flore) which gets deleted by apocope. Child Spanish speakers with SLI in the United States have shown mixed results in their abilities to learn plural marking. They have shown low proficiency on an elicited production task, but have shown high proficiency in spontaneous production data. We show, using a new elicited production task in Mexico with a group of children diagnosed with SLI and two control groups, that performance is close to the high levels previously shown in spontaneous production studies. Further, we show that all children's performance with the epenthetic allomorph /es/ is worse than their performance with the canonical allomorph /s/. Our results suggest that plural marking is not an axis of cross-linguistic variation between Spanish and English among children with SLI. On the basis of the absence of child errors of the flore type and presence of errors of the flors type, our data appear to support the epenthesis account of Harris (1991).},

In the overt subject languages, subjects are realized in the canonical specifier-of-IP position, whereas in the null subject languages (such as Catalan and Spanish), subjecs are located in a topic/focus position, which becomes acessible only later in development. AS evidence for this, I show that overt subjects, fronted objects, and wh-questions begin to be used at the same point in development in child Catalan and Spanish. I also argue that subject agreement constitutes an incorporated pronominal subject in Catalan and Spanish and that children converge on this parametric option very early. Teh inability of child Spanish- and Catalan-speakers to use discourse-pragmatic information is explained as a delay in the development of hte interface between grammar and discourse-pragmatics.},

  abstract = {This paper argues that short (clause-internal) scrambling to a pre-subject position has A-properties in Japanese but A'-properties in German, while long scrambling (scrambling across sentence boundaries) form finite clauses, which is possible in Japanese but not in German, has A'-properties throughout. It is shown that these differences between German and Japanese can be traced back to parametric variation of phrase structure and the parameterized properties of functional heads. Due to the properties of Agreement, sentences in Japaense may contain multiple (Agro- and Agrs-) specifiers whereas German does not allow for this. In Japanese, a scrambled element may be located in a Spec AgrP, i.e., an A- or L-related position, whereas scrambled NPs in German can only appear in an AgrP-adjoined (broadly-L-related) position, which only has A'-properties. Given our assumption that successive cyclic adjunction is generally impossible, elements in German may not be long scrambled because a scrambled element that is moved to an adjunction site inside an embedded clause may not move further. In Japanese, long distance scrambling out of finite CPs is possible since scrambling may proceed in a successive cyclic manner via embedded Spec-(AgrP) positions. Our analysis of the differences between German and Japanese scrambling provides us with an account of further contrasts between the two langauge such as the existence of surprising asymmetries between German and Japanese remnant-movement phenomena, and the fact that , unlike German, Japanese freely allows wh-scrambling. Investigation of the properties of Japaense wh-movement also leads us to the formulation of the wh-cluster Hypothesis, which implies that Japanese is an LF multiple wh-fronting language.},

Another central claim of the article is that despite appearances, multiple wh questions in German equally involve the formation of wh clusters, which are shown to consist of one visible and one or more invisible wh elements.

Overall both groups of children associated BIN with the distant past; however, the AAE-speaking children were twice as likely to give a distant past response on the ``BIN went'' task. These results are discussed in terms of event realization, the Aspect Hypothesis, and feature agreement. We delineate a path that uses the lexical part ofthe Aspect Hypothesis, teh role of sematnics in defining the end stat of a refined aspectual system, and an interface bweteen syntax and semantics to explain subtel steps involving agreement in the acquisition process. Teh AAE-speaking children scored significantly higher on the habitual $\backslash$emphbe tasks than the SwLVE-speaking children, whose scores were not significantly different from chance. The results suggest that the AAE-speaking children have developing native knowledge of habitual `be' and are beginning to associate it with eventualities that recur.},

  volume = {8},
  abstract = {This paper examines aspectual be-type constructions in African American English. These constructions receive a habitual interpretation, but they are distinguished from simple tense generics in that they are not ambiguous between generic/habitual and capacity readings. The analysis proposed to account for these constructions is one in which aspectual be neutralizes the distinction between stage- and individual-level predicates. Following Kratzer (1995), I assume that stage-level predicates have a separate event argument associated with them, but individual-level predicates do not. Aspectual be forces individual-level predicates to take an eventuality argument which coerces them into stage-level predicates. Teh logical representations of these constructions are given a tripartite structure in which a habitual operator binds variables ranging over eventualities. The analysis can be extended to account for constructions in which permanently stable entities indicated by bare plural subjects occur with be-type predicates. The solution proposed here accounts for some well-known properties of aspectual be that have not been discussed in the literature.},

This paper presents two experiments examining the relative scope assigned to disjunction and negation by English-speaking learners of Japanese (Experiment 1) and Japanese-speaking learners of English (Experiment 2). Previous evidence from L1 acquisition shows a protracted initial default for the interpretation of the relative scope of disjunction and negation. Our results show no such default in L2 acquisition, contra the predictions of Epstein et al. (1996). Instead, we find evidence of L1 transfer, suggesting `Full Transfer' at the L2 initial state extends to the domain of semantics. Results also show uneven success in the two L2 groups, which is explained through the different learnability scenarios that arise as a result of transfer and the availability of positive evidence in the L2 input.},

Yet the analysis of adult French corpora has shown the consistent occurrence of referential null objects in speech and writing. These constructions, although clearly marked, put into question a major premise of syntactic analyses of object-clitic constructions\textemdash{}namely, that sentences referring to a specific, referential object but lacking both a clitic and a postverbal object are necessarily ungrammatical. The goal of this paper is to present a revised analysis of object-clitic constructions that is capable of integrating referential null objects. It is proposed that the zero morpheme constitutes the default realization of the accusative clitic head and is inserted if this head is underspecified for Case. The analysis extends naturally to account for predicate le, as well as to errors observed in child language development, in particular the overuse of masculine singular le as well as object (-clitic) omission. It is proposed that the syntactic representation underlying clitic drop in child and adult French is identical, yet child and adult French differ with regard to the reason for the underspecification of the clitic head.},

  abstract = {In this paper we discuss the structure of a kind of Catalan compounds that seem to contradict Lieber's proposal that there is a single parameter fixing the position of hte head with respect to complements, modifiers and specifiers for both syntax ad morphology. Catalan has a kind of compound formed by a verbal root, the head, preceded by an inalienable possession noun (IPN). These compounds pose two problems. The first one has to do with the order of elements in the compounds: They seem to hold an OV order instead of the regular VO order of Catalan. The second problem is related to the semantic interpretation of hte construciton: the Theme of a verbal phrase headed by these compounds is also interpreted as the possessor of the IPN within the compound. We claim, first, that the IPN is not complement of the verbal root but a modifier. Second, we claim that Catalan modifiers are always generated in a pre-head position, both in morphology and in syntax. In syntactici structures they appear after the head because the head raises to check its features. In morphology, on the other hand, the movement does not exist, so the modifier remains to the left of the head. Finally, the double interpretation of the object is a consequence of a process of lexical subordination of the IPN's Lexical Conceptual Structure to the Lexcial Conceptual STructure of the verbal root in the lexical process of composition.},

Parry (1998a) takes these structures to be in complementary distribution, claiming that che preempts V-to-C movement in interrogative inversion and destroys the licensing environment for interrogative clitics. In this paper, I argue for the revision of this claim. Building on Chomsky's (1995) checking theory, I propose an analysis of Piedmontese interrogatives in the spirit of Roberts and Roussou's (1999) dissociation of features [wh] and [Q]. I maintain that interrogative V-to-C movement and matrix wh+che questions target different CPs, hence the verb in C and che do not compete for the same position. Factors other than syntactic ones are responsible for the rare use of interrogative clitics in wh+che structures.

It is claimed that languages adopt weight distinctions that are phoneticallymost effective without being overly complex phonologically.

Marked types of morphology (infixes, circumfixes, zero affixes; subtractive, reduplicative and templatic morphology) are represented in exactly the same way as roots. The markedness of such morphology is arged to follow from the high ranking of the violated constraints in question.},

The analysis uses purely phonological constraints without recourse to language-specific or meter-specific constraints and without an abstract metrical template (Helsloot 1997). I show that the number of tokens per metrical type correlates with phonological well-formedness in one of five areas: binarity, weight, alignment, identity, and thythm. In addition, I showt hat poems written in this meter have no perfectly metrical lines in them: every line violates some constraint because absolute metrical well-formedness is not possible given the constraints in this type of meter. Gradient well-formedness in meter (Youmans 1989) is shown to be both demonstrable and formalizable.},

  abstract = {English reultative expressions have been a major focus of research on the syntax-semantics interface. We argue in this article that a family of related constructions is required to account for their distribution. We demonstrate that a number of generalizations follow from the semantics of the constructions we posit: the syntactic argument structure of the sentence is predicted by general principles of argument linking: and the aspectual structure of the sentence is determined by the aspectual structure of the constructional subevent, which is in turn predictable from general principles correlating event structure with change, extension, motin, and paths. Finally, the semantics and syntax of resultatives explain the possibilities for temporal relations between the two subevents. While these generalizations clearly exist, there is also a great deal of idiosyncrasy involved in resultatives. many idiosyncratic instances and small subclasses of the construction must be learned and stored individually. This account serves to justify aspects of what we share in our overall vision of grammar, what we might call the constructional view. To the extent that our treatment of the resultative can be stated only within the constructional view, it serves as evidence for this view as a whole.},

Sandstr\"o m proposes that for events described in the simple past, the temporal interpretation of such sequences varies according to whether A describes a culminated process (CP)(accomplishment) or a culmination (CULM)(roughly, an achievement). She offers an account of this behaviour based on the claim that culminations denote changes of state while culminated processes do not. I argue that this claim is unmotivated, and in addition, draw attention to a range of counterexamples to her generalisation. I present an analysis which is not based on the CP/CULM distinction but relies instead on the distinction originally proposed by Dowty (1979) between the event structures CAUSE-BECOME and BECOME. I show that this distinction is closely related to whether the event has a prototypical agent. It is therefore thematic structure rather than temporal structure that determines the behaviour of when in these cases.},

The relevance of these contexts is twofold: on the one hand, they exhibit very consistent behaviour across Romance languages with respect to mood selection, in that they always select the indicative in their complement clause, rejecting the subjunctive. On the other hand, their interpretive properties change according to the tense used: when containing a subordinate imperfect indicative tense, dream reports have the property that the dreamed eventuality need not be temporally anchored; at the same time, they do not seem to ascribe any specific attitude to the subject (the dreamer). When containing a non-imperfect indicative tense, temporal anchoring is available, and a particular evidential meaning can be detected, revealing the presence of a speaker-oriented attitude towards the content of the dream. The connection between temporal anchoring and the presence/absence of a propositional attitude will be investigated: semantically, within an extensional, truth-theoretical framework by arguing in favour of a reflexive/tensed-thoughts approach to propositional attitudes; and in its morphosyntactic aspects, by motivating a conception according to which the interaction between the temporal features of T and the features of C provide the interface conditions for the interpretive facts to arise.},

We suggest that this provides data that demonstrates that updates resulting from utterances cannot be defined in purely semantic terms, contrary to the prevailing assumptions of existing approaches to dynamic semantics. We offer a computationally oriented analysis of the resolution of ellipsis in certain cases of dialogue clarification. We show that this goes beyond standard techniques used in anaphora and ellipsis resolution and requires operations on highly structured, linguistically heterogeneous representations. We characterize these operations and the representations on which they operate. We offer an analysis couched in a version of Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar combined with a theory of information states (IS) in dialogue. We sketch an algorithm for the process of utterance integration in IS which leads to grounding or clarification. The account proposed here has direct applications to the theory of attitude reports, an issue which is explored briefly in the concluding remarks of the paper.},

  abstract = {Most linguistic theories since Chomsky (1973) have hypothesized that long-distance dependencies crossing multiple clauses are mediated by intermediate structures. This paper provides a new source of evidence for the existence of such intermediate structures: reading times during online sentence comprehension. The experiment presented here compares reading times for two structures involving the long-distance extraction of a $\backslash$emphwh-filler: (a) a structure in which a clause intervenes bewteen the endpoints of the extraction, and (b) a structure in which a nominalization of the clause intervenes. The logic of the experiment relies on two hypotheses: first, that intermedieate structures mediate the relationship bewteen a $\backslash$emphwh-filler and its theta-role-assigning verb when a clause interves between them but not when a nominalizaiton intervenes; and second, that reading times for a word increase as linear distance increases between teh word and the position on which it is dependent in the partial structure for the input (Gibson 1998, 2000; Grodner, Watson \& Gibson 2000). In combination, these hypotheses predict that reading times at the region in which the verb assigns a theta-role to the $\backslash$emphwh-filler will be faster in the clausal conditions whan in the nominalized conditions, because in the clausal conditions intermediate structure mediate the $\backslash$emphwh-filler verb dependency and case it to be more local. This prediction was confirmed.},

I propose that Greek NC instantiates this option. Greek n-words will be analyzed as polarity sensitive universal quantifiers whcih need negation in order to be licensed, but must raise above negation in order to yield the scoping Anot. This gives the correct interpretation of NC structures as general negative statements. The effect is achieved by application of QR, and the account is fully compositional, as only sentence negation is the vehicle of logical negation. Greek n-words are also compared to n-words in Romance, Slavic, and Hungarian. This analysis, if correct, has two important consequences. First, the analysis will provide a strong argument for retaining QR in the syntax-semantics mapping: we neet it in order to interpret NC. Second, by employing a mechanism which is present in the grammar for the scope of quantifiers anyway, we have a simpler theory which makes NC look less anomalous; appeal to a mechanism invoked just to account for NC, as in the "negative absorption" tradition, is thus rendered unnecessary.},

  volume = {83},
  abstract = {The main focus of this article is the occurrence of some polarity items (PIs) in the complements of emotive factive verbs and only. This fact has been taken as a challenge to the semantic approach to PIs (Linebarger 1980), because only and factive verbs are not downward entailing (DE). A modification of the classical DE account is proposed by introducing the notion of nonveridicality (Zwarts 1995, Giannakidou 1998, 1999, 2001) as the one crucial for PI sanctioning. To motivate this move, it is first shown that two solutions in the direction of weakening classical monotonicity do not work: Strawson DE (von Fintel 1999) and weak DE (Hoeksema 1986). Weakening DE systematically either overgenerates or undergenerates, in either case failing to characterize the correct set of licensers. Nonveridicality is introduced as a conservative extension of DE and is shown to account for PIs also in contexts that are not DE (i.e. questions, modal verbs, imperatives, directive propositional attitudes). This theory, augmented with the premise that certain PIs (i.e. the liberal class represented by any) are subject to a weaker polarity dependency identified not as LICENSING but as RESCUING by nonveridicality, explains the occurrence of this particular class with only and emotive factive verbs. Crosslinguistic comparisons illustrate that the occurrence of PIs with only and emotive factives is not a general phenomenon, and further support the dual nature of polarity dependency and the semantic characterization of the elements that license or rescue PIs.},

  title = {The {{Landscape}} of {{EVEN}}},
  volume = {25},
  abstract = {This paper explores the role that the scalar properties and presuppositions of even play in creating polarity sensitive even meanings crosslinguistically (henceforth EVEN). I discuss the behavior of three lexically distinct Greek counterparts of even in positive, negative, subjunctive sentences, and polar questions. These items are shown to be polarity sensitive, and a three-way distinction is posited between a positive polarity (akomi ke), a negative polarity (oute), and a `flexible scale'even (esto) which does not introduce likelihood, but is associated with scales made salient by the context. The analysis is a refinement of Rooth's original idea that negative polarity is involved in the interpretation of English even, and establishes further that the ``negative'' polarity domain of EVEN includes a sensitivity that is not strictly speaking negative (flexible scale esto). The distributional restrictions of EVEN items are shown to follow from distinct presuppositions (positive polarity and flexible scale EVEN), or from their lexical featural specification (negative polarity EVEN), a result that squares neatly with the fact that ill-formedness is systematic pragmatic deviance in the former case but robust ungrammaticality in the latter. This result supports the by now widely accepted view that polarity dependencies are not of uniform nature, and that we need to distinguish presupposition failures (which are weaker and possibly fixable in some contexts) from cases of ungrammaticality which are robust and cannot be fixed in any context (Giannakidou, 2001).},

  volume = {28},
  abstract = {In this brief commentary, I consider Hoeksema's data on enig and sug- gest that there is actually no shift from non-veridicality to downward entailment, but rather from weak to strong negative polarity. This shift in distribution comes with a change in intonation, observed often with strong NPIs crosslinguistically (Greek, Korean, Japanese). The path of enig to strong NPI-hood can therefore be regarded as grammaticalizing intonational properties as well. In comparing the older versus more modern usages of Dutch enig, I suggest that the two major sources for NPI-hood known from the literature, scalarity and referential deficiency, may correlate with the weak versus strong NPI distinction. Finally, it is suggested that the distributional change comes with a concomitant meaning shift and the emergence of an additional scalar dimension in the Modern Dutch NPI enig (e.g. via an EVEN component).},

Drawing on a corpus of examples gathered from natural speech, written texts, and television scripts, we show that CR restricts the interpretation of the copied element to a 'real' or prototypical reading. Turning to the structural properties of the construction, we show that CR is unusual among reduplication phenomena in that whole idioms can be copied, object pronouns are often copied (as in the second example above), and inflectional morphology need not be copied. Thus the 'scope' of CR cannot be defined in purely phonological terms; rather, a combination of phonological, morphosyntactic, syntactic, and lexical factors is involved. We develop an anlysis within the parallel architecture framework of Jackendoff (1997, 2002), whereby CR is treated as a lexical item with syntactic and semantic content and reduplicative phonology. We then sketch an alternative analysis, based on current assumptions within the Minimalist Program, which involves movement into a focusl-like position with both the head and the tail of the resulting chain spelled out.},

While there has been discussion as to which inflectional categories project structure, the question of whether lexical categories project has not been raised. In this paper it is claimed that common nouns in Persian do not project to maximal categories, i.e. do not appear with a complement and a specifier position. Several facts follow as a consequence. First, we explain an intriguing property of Ezafe construcution in Modern Persian, namely that all modifiers of nouns must be heads themselves. We also have an explanation for the presence of the Ezafe vowel itself, which is analyzed as a linker affixed to Xos at PF to identify elements forming a nominal constituent. Finally, we explain why only one possessor is possible within Persian noun phrases. Since nouns cannot project complement and specifier positions, the only position available for a possessor is [SPEC, DP].},

We show that this is false and propose an alternative theory, according to which superlative modifiers (at least/most) are quite different from comparative ones (more/less/fewer than).

We argue that this analysis explains various facts that are problematic for the naive view, which have to do with specificity, distributional differences between superlative and comparative modifiers, differential patterns of inference licensed by these expressions, and the way they interact with various operators, like modals and negation.},

My analysis differs from Zimmermann's in that it is more general and renders the logical form of disjunctive sentences less complex, but the main innovation is that the context dependence of modality is called upon to play a leading role. The theory applies not only to disjunctions of `may'-sentences but also covers universal modalities and conditional disjuncts. The paper concludes with a discussion of narrow-scope `or'.},

Five experiments examined English-speaking two-year-olds' omissions of object ariticles in different prosodic structures. The data indicate that children omit unfooted syllables and that foot boundaries, in turn, are influenced by prosodic word and phonological phrase boundaries. Thus, it appears that children create prosodic stuctures remarkably similar to those proposed in theories of prosodic phonology.},

We develop an analysis according to which a moved N does not adjoin to a functional category; rather, it moves out of its projection and remerges with it. This movement is (indirectly) triggered by a certain kind of categorial probe feature that we call a ''Muenchhausen feature'' (Fanselow 2003). In this way, conceptual problems resulting from head movement conceived as adjunction of one head to another are avoided. Furthermore, one of the main arguments for D as the head of the nominal projection (namely, that evidence for N movement is also evidence for DP on top of NP) is refuted. In addition to showing that an NP approach to nominal projections is viable (given reprojection), we also provide one independent argument for it: the reprojection approach to NP structure turns out to automatically derive a core assumption that must otherwise be stipulated in the theories of word-order variation in nominal projections developed by Cinque (2005) and Abels $\backslash$\& Neeleman (2006) (namely, that only those projections can undergo movement within nominal projections that contain N).},

The grammar in focus is that of Palauan, whose basic order is VOS. A principled distinction among SVO, VOS, and other grammars is provided by a specifier parameter, which sets the specifier position in realtion to that of other constituents of the phrase and determines how specifiers are governed.

Focusing on so-called 'raised possessors' in West Greenlandic noun incorporating constructions and presenting some new data, I discuss some problems that arise if we use the derivational framework of Bittner and Hale (1996) to analyze them. I show that if we make the predication relations in noun incorporating constructions overt in their syntax and if we adopt a dynamic approach to semantics, a base-generated syntactic input enriched with a coindexation system is all that we need to arrive at an adequate semantic interpretation of these constructions.},

  abstract = {In this paper, I develop a novel interval-based approach to some well-known semantic puzzles related to aspect shift, in particular, to the interaction of for-adverbials with accomplishment and achievement verbs that take indefinite, bare plural, and mass noun complements. My approach is based on the insight that implicit frequentative aspect plays a central role in this interaction, a fact that was largely ignored in previous analyses. Specifically, I interpret frequentative aspect as an abstract verb-level pluractional operator that brings about aspect shift and that is responsible for the distribution of subevent times and subevent participants over the event time of an atelic sentence. What Zucchi and White (2001) call "the aspectual effect of frequency adverbs" thus becomes the general rule for all frequentatively understood for-adverbial sentences. Linguistic support for silent verb-level frequentativity in English is drawn from overt frequentative aspect marking in West Greenlandic verbs.},

Drawing on the generative literature in phonological acquisition, as well as the work of phoneticians and psycholinguists, we offer alternative parsing algorithms and examine their implications for learnability and the initial ranking of Optimality Theory constraints. Finally, we propose that the resolution of the comprehension/production dilemma lies not in the phonological domain (linguistic competence), but in the domain of the implementation of linguistic knowledge (performance).},

However, explanatory adequacy requires us to account for all acquisition \textendash{} this includes the acquisition of grammars that diverge from their sources (i.e., change) as well as that of fully convergent grammars. This paper argues that an adequate explanation of change phenomena is unattainable given the current widespread confusion regarding such critical conepts as "language," "language change," and "syntax." It seeks to develop a coherent theory of syntactic change, which necessitates clarification of these fundamental matters. I believe that syntactic change should fall out from an adequate theory of syntax (along with a learning algorithm). This paper frames these issues within a Minimalist perspective. Finally, I present evidence that the study of change may provide valuable insights into the proper characterizaton of certain syntactic phenomena within current syntactic theory.},

Complex Predicates presents this wide area of phenomena in a concise and insightful manner, and develops an analysis that is based on few specific assumptions in the framework of Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG). This said, the book obviously targets an audience wider than HPSG. Chapter 1 offers a brief introduction into general assumptions of the framework, developed along with a basic HPSG-analysis of German clause structure, and throughout the book the author has made every effort to find a good balance between empirical scrutiny, theoretical explicitness, and accessibility for readers who are not familiar with HPSG.

Children at the same age acquiring other languages make errors with subject case and with tense or agreement inflections on the verb, which has been analyzed by Wexler (1998) as stemming from a constraint on child grammars that prevents the subject from moving to two functional projections. The proposal here is that the child Korean errors result from the same constraint. This leads to an analysis of negation in adult Korean under which the VP material is base generated between the negator anand the verb, moving leftward in adult Korean. The child errors are then a result of omitting object-related functional projections that would drive this movement, paralleling Wexler's analysis of Optional Infinitives in other languages. The analysis presented here not only offers an explanation of the child errors but also constrains the possible analyses for negation in adult Korean in ways that are not obvious from the adult data alone.},

The word order in the IPP construction is derived by head movement of the auxiliary and XP-movement of the IPP complement. The IPP complement moves to [Spec, FP2] to check its formal features; the finite auxiliary moves either to F2 or to the higher functional head, T or Neg; the nonfinite auxiliary remains in F2.

On the one hand, it is a lexical verb, with an experiencer argument; on the other hand, it behaves like a ``restructuring verb.'' In the latter case, sembrare is incompatible with an experiencer argument and it allows clitic climbing. This article identifies several contexts in which clitic climbing is not possible with sembrare and offers an account in terms of Cinque's proposals about the functional hierarchy of the clause. The article also examines sembler, the French cognate of sembrare, and argues, contra Cinque 2002, that it behaves like a lexical verb. Finally, it shows that the two instantiations of Italian sembrare correspond to two verbs in Dutch: schijnen and lijken.},

This movement analysis of conditional clauses is shown to account for the incompatibility of main clause phenomena and conditional clauses in terms of intervention effects. The cartographic implementation of this analysis predicts that conditional clauses will be incompatible with speaker-oriented modal expressions and that conditional clauses will lack the low-construal reading found in temporal clauses (Bhatt and Pancheva 2002, 2006). Thus, the absence of low construal in conditional clauses, which was initially taken to be an obstacle for the movement account of conditional clauses (see Citko 2000), becomes an argument in its favor.},

  abstract = {This paper develops an account of do-support in VP focus constructions in Central and Western Basque (CWB) dialects. In particular, this paper argues that CWB dialects, along with Korean, form a class of do-support languages whose dummy verb insertion mechanism differs slightly from that of English and Monnese. In all four of these languages, the dummy verb occupies a position that is, in marked environments, inaccessible to the verb. However, in Korean and CWB, unlike in English and Monnese, the verb's inability to raise to value this feature is not due to its inflectional poverty, but rather because it must bear a nominalizing infinitival affix for independent reasons; this nominal infinitive may not bear aspectual morphology, and a dummy verb is merged to do so instead. Moreover, Basque do-support is not a last-resort phenomenon as in Chomsky's classic analysis of English do-support (Chomsky 1957). That is, the unavailability of do-support in non-verb focalization constructions is not due to competition with a more economical alternative, but rather is independently excluded. This approach avoids a violation of the Inclusiveness Condition inherent in economy-based approaches to do-support that generate the dummy verb in the computational component.},

The proportional quantifier most, in particular, supplied the initial motivation for adopting Generalized Quantifier Theory (GQT) because its meaning is definable as a relation between sets of individuals, which are taken to be semantic primitives in GQT. This paper proposes an alternative analysis of most that does not treat it as a lexical item whose meaning is accessible without the help of compositional processes. Instead, proportional most is analyzed as the superlative of many (cf. Bresnan Linguist Inq 4(3):274\textendash{}344, 1973). Two types of empirical evidence are presented in support of this view, both exploiting the fact that only a decompositional analysis of proportional quantifiers provides the means to generate different logical forms for seemingly equivalent statements of the form most A B and more than half of the A B.},

It is shown that ECV2s in Frisian have generally the properties of root CPs and that there is no reason to analyze such constructions differenlty from structural roots. As a consequence, the approach defended here treats ECV2s and their matrix cluases as a combination of indpeendent expressions, i.e., as expressions having their own illocutionary role. This accounts for restrictions on the distribution of embedded V2. Finally, it is demonstrated along the lines of Hoeksema nd Napoli (1993) that ECV2s in Frisian are juxtaposed with their matrix cluases, i.e. they should be distinguished as cases of parataxis from 'normal' coordination.},

But in contrast to previous studies showing that children have problems interpreting sentences with accented and unaccented auch, we found indications for adult-like comprehension in an eye-tracking experiment by children from 3 years on. These results reflect early availability of adult-like linguistic competence with respect to both auch-variants which does not always lead to adult-like performance. This variation in children's performance across tasks is considered to be due to additional modality and task specific constraints. Development in this area thus reflects not a change in underlying knowledge, but rather a change in the constraints on its behavioral manifestation.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a semantic analysis of several contrasting properties between the Spanish plural existential determiners unos `a-pl.' and algunos `some-pl.' is presented within the framework of Discourse Representation Theory (DRT). Some of these properties can be directly related to the distinction between the thetic and the categorical judgment, as understood by Kuroda and Ladusaw. Others, related to plurality and the interaction of quantifiers, provide evidence for an extension of the scope of the distinction and its implementation as a procedural semantic difference. It will be argued that the determiner unos contributes a group discourse referent to a Discourse Representation Structure (DRS). This discourse referent is subject to a no linking constraint, and does not trigger box-splitting of the DRS. This forms the basis for the claim that this plural determiner participates only in thetic judgments. On the other hand, the determiner algunos is not subject to a no linking constraint and may contribute a duplex condition to the DRS. Thus, it can participate in categorical judgments. This type of judgment corresponds to a set of construction rules which yields an updated DRS in which a new discourse referent has been introduced and, in contrast to the thetic judgment, a linking condition and a duplex condition are introduced. The analysis is extended to account for the effects of contrastive focus and scopal interactions with other operators in the semantics of Spanish existential determiners.},

  abstract = {This paper deals with a number of facts related to the word order of Spanish declarative clauses and develops an analysis where the unmarked word order of Spanish clauses with different classes of verbs is not determined by syntactic conditions such as Case or agreement, but rather by structural conditions that are closely related to the thematic role of the different arguments of the verb. The analysis is based on a set of data that point to the conclusion that even though unmarked word order in Spanish is not determined by Case or agreement considerations, it is still mostly regulated by the EPP. However, these same data indicate that (a) the EPP is a requirement operative in some constructions but not in others, and (b) phrases other than the subject DP can satisfy the EPP. This paper develops an Optimality Theoretic account of these facts where the core of the analysis consists of introducing the notion of the Pole of the clause, defined as the highest specifier of the inflectional layer, and developing a set of markedness constraints whose interaction determines when and whether this specifier position is occupied. Central to this analysis are the characterization of the EPP as a violable constraint that requires the Pole specifier to be filled, and the use of Harmonic Alignment to formalize a hierarchy of markedness constraints that target the relative markedness of an argument or adjunct when it occupies the Pole specifier, independently of the grammatical relation it bears.},

Rhythm can be accounted for by constraints like NoClash, forbidding adjacent accents within the phonological phrase. Constituency has been accounted for by a cyclic application of right-alignment and left-alignment of accents in the phonological phrase. However, such an account fails to take care of multiply premodified NPs like Fifteen Japanese CDs. Ranking right-alignment above left-alignment gives fifTEEN japaNESE ceeDEES and the reverse ranking gives the equally unacceptable FIFteen JAPanese CEEdees. Abandoning a cyclic treatment, I propose a procliticized structure in which procliticized phonological phrases correspond to embedding premodifiers like fifteen in the above example. Such premodifiers align with the left edge with a phonological phrase but fail to align their right edge with a phonological phrase. As a result, the correct (FIFteen (JAPaNESE ceeDEES)) is produced, or, if NoClash is given a stricter interpretation so as to ban accents with only one unaccented syllable between them, the equally correct (FIFteen (JAPanese ceeDEES)). A systematic but hitherto unnoticed stress contrast is discussed, that between e.g. TOO high BUILdings and TWO HIGH BUILdings, and it is shown that the new account deals with it effortlessly.},

  abstract = {In this paper, I explore the possibility of understanding locality restrictions on the distribution of Negative Polarity Items (NPIs) as a consequence of covert movement. The present proposal restates Linebarger's Immediate Scope Constraint in terms of morphology-driven checking requirements. These requirements cannot be met if a blocking element intervenes between the NPI feature and its morphosemantic licenser at Logical Form (LF). The empirical generalization is that the class of NPI `blocking expressions' (a.k.a. `interveners') overlaps to a large extent with interveners identified in wh-questions. Therefore, the same grammatical checking mechanisms operating in that domain, rather than the presence of an implicature, are here shown to be responsible both for apparent violations to Linebarger's constraint (contra Linebarger) and for intervention effects (contra Krifka, 1995, and Chierchia, 2004). This approach is argued to be superior on empirical grounds as it predicts facts that are left unaccounted for in a theory like Linebarger's, where pragmatics rescues otherwise ill-formed structures. In addition, the proposal allows us to view the locality constraints operating in the domain of NPI-licensing as an instance of more general (though yet to be fully understood) principles of the grammar whose effects are attested in other domains, such as wh-questions in German, Discourse- linked (D-linked) wh-questions in English, and Negative Concord (NC) configurations (e.g. in Italian and French).},

To account for children's behavioral pattern, we propose a new factor at play in Truth Value Judgment tasks: the Question\textendash{}Answer Requirement (QAR). According to the QAR, children (and adults) must interpret the target sentence that they evaluate as an answer to a question that is made salient by the discourse.},

Our solution,which employs recent work on reduplication and metathesis,allows us to account for seemingly disparate phenomena as special cases of a single general framework and demonstrates that these operations are more versatile than previously thought.

In this paper I review two recent discussions by Lieber and Zwicky which attempt tp account for a particular subclass of soft mutation by an appeal to case. I argue that neither successfully accounts for the full range of relevant data and suggest a novel interpretation of the phenomenon which generalises beyond the occurrence of soft mutation in NPs to its occurrence in other categories. Instead of an account founded on a treatment of soft mutation as a manifestation of case, I propose that it can be satisfactorily and elegantly accounted for if we recognise phrasal categories as triggers of phonological phenomena.},

We further show how these shortcomings are avoided by the lexicalist analysis proposed by Hankamer and Mikkelsen (2002) and compare it with an alternative DM analysis that does not rely on head movement in the syntax.

We propose that preposed negation in non-$\backslash$emphwh-questions and preposed negative adverbials in declaratives necessarily contribute focus marking (in particular, verum focus) and argue that the lack of wide scope disjunction reading in both declaratives and non-$\backslash$emphwh-questions results as a by-product of the interaction between focus and the LF syntax of disjunctive structures, which we argue involves ellipsis.},

  abstract = {In a head-final language, V-raising is hard to detect since there is no evidence from the string to support a raising analysis. If the language has a cliticlike negation that associates with the verb in syntax, then scope facts concerning negation and a quantified object NP could provide evidence regarding the height of the verb. Even so, such facts are rare, especially in the input to children, and so we might expect that not all speakers exposed to a head-final language acquire the same grammar as far as V-raising is concerned. Here, we present evidence supporting this expectation. Using experimental data concerning the scope of quantified NPs and negation in Korean, elicited from both adults and 4-year-old children, we show that there are two populations of Korean speakers: one with V-raising and one without.},

The paper shows that just as in English, past tense morphology can be used to convey counterfactuality in Korean. While this fact accounts for many similarities between English and Korean counterfactuals, some differences between the two languages are also attested. The variation in form-meaning mapping between English and Korean counterfactuals is accounted for with the proposal that once the past tense is mapped onto the meaning component that conveys counterfactuality, the range of possible temporal interpretations for a counterfactual is literally determined by the LF of the relevant clause minus the past tense morpheme. If this LF has a present (or past) interpretation, the counterfactual will have a present (or past) interpretation. But if this LF is not interpretable, the counterfactual will not be interpretable either, resulting in ungrammaticality.},

Moreover, the children under investigation use structures in this phase that are found neither in the state of Early Null Subjects nor in adult German, namely postverbal referential null subjects. The latter result, the fact that this stage is not final, and the differences to object-drop at the same time strongly suggest that the phenomenon cannot only be topic-drop. An analysis is proposed admitting competing strategies for a certain tiem, a topic-drop strategy (i.e., a strategy of identification via discourse), and a strategy of licensing and identifying null subjects through feature transfer under Government.},

West Germanic is characterized by, among other things, the gemination of all consonants \textendash{} except *r \textendash{} after a short vowel and before *j (Gmc *skapjan $>$ OS skeppian, OE scieppan vs. Got skapjan, ON skepjai'to create') and the gemination of voiceless stops before *r and *l (*akr- $>$ OHG akkar, OS akkar vs. Got. akrs, ON akr 'field'). Evidence from versification and word division in original documents suggests that all Germanic dialects favored bimoraic stressed syllables, syllabifying *skapjan as *skap.jan, for example. Thsi often resulted in faulty syllable contacts in which the coda consonant was less sonorous than the following onset. Murray and Vennemann (1983) propose that genimates arose in order to repair such faulty syllable contacts (e.g., *skap.jan $>$ *skap.pjan), but their analysis fails to satisfactorily account for the full scope of the West Germanic Gemination. I propose here that while gemination before *r and *l was driven by favorable sonority differences at syllable margins, the more pervasive appearance of geminates before *j simply resulted from a well-attested Germanic dispreference for *j in onset-initial position.},

A head may therefore licesne the specifier of its complement (as well as its complement) but not its own specifier (it is not local enough). This effectively elminates the spec-head configuration from the repertoire of syntactic configurations, in favor of a unified notion of locality strictly identifiable with mutual c-command, a symmetric configuration.

In the scope of the progressive, the proportion named by a proportionality quantifier (e.g. most in The software was detecting most errors) must hold in every subevent of the event so described, indicating that a predicate in the scope of the progressive is interpreted as an internally homogeneous activity. Such an activity interpretation is argued to be available for telic predicates (e.g. cross the street) because these receive a partitive interpretation except in combination with a completive operator, which asserts that the event so described has culminated. The obligatoriness of the completive operator in the preterit is shown to parametrically distinguish those languages that show completion entailments in the preterit, e.g. English, from those that do not, e.g. Malagasy, Hindi, and Japanese.},

In a discussion of Latin enclitic stress it is shown that this erasure of metrical structure must be combined with stages in the derivation where previously assigned metrical structure is srupulously resepected. This leads to a digression concerning the similar enclitic stress in the Austronesian language Manam. Attention is then focussed on the fact that in some languages\textendash{} e.g., in Winnebago\textendash{} foot boundaries may occur inside sylklables that have more than one stress-bearing element, whereas in other languages\textendash{} e.g., in Cairene Arabic and Yupik Eskimo\textendash{} syllable-internal foot boundaries are not allowed. To deal with this type of variablility it is proposed that in addition to idiosyncratic stresses the theoretical framework must admit also idiosyncratic constituent boundaries.

Since the theory predicts that loss of lexical accent should result in initial stress, the initial stress found, for example in Celtic, Germanic, and Italic, is attributed to this loss.

Semai, a language spoken in Malaysian, presents an interesting challenge for such an analysis. The surface form of the reduplicant in the phenomenon presented here is a string of two consonants. This type of reduplicaiton fits in with the classification of bare-consonant reduplication, where a surface reduplicant is either a single consonant or a string of two consonants. In this paper, I discuss the difficulties in applying a prosodic template analysis to this data, and I propose an alternative account. This alternative account is formulated under the Compression Model, a model in which the shape of a reduplicant is determined by the satisfaction of morphological alignment constraints, not by the use of a prosodic template.},

Carstens's arguments against Chomsky's (2000, 2001) system of theta-complete Case checking are also discussed and a new argument against Chomsky's system is presented that demands theta and Case feature checking relations be divorced.

This paper argues agaist this view based on an anlysis of specificational pseudoclefts in Hebrew. Pseudoclefts in Hebrew are interesting in two ways. First predicational and specificational pseudoclefts are distinguished lexically in the choice of the copula. Second specificational pseudoclefts fall into two classes, each exhibitin a different set of connectivity effects. The connectivity pattern in Hebrew is accounted for following Jacobson (1994) and Sharvit (1999), who assume that connectivity effects are independent of each other and derive them as a by-product of semantic equation. It is shown that this pattern cannot be obtained using any single grammatical operation, such as reconstruction or copying, which would necessarily derive all connectivity effects at once.},

We take issue with this conclusion on two grounds. First, the intractability result holds only in cases where the constraint set is not fixed in advance (contra usual definitions of OT), and second, the result crucially depends on a particular representation of OT grammars. We show that there is an alternative representation of OT grammars that allows for efficient computation of optimal surface forms and provides deeper insight into the sources of complexity of OT. We conclude that it is a mistake to reject OT on the grounds that it is computationally intractable.},

The proposed learner is simple, efficient, and provably correct, and does not require an a priori notion of tier or projection (contra the model in Hayes and Wilson 2008); nor does it rely on the additional structure provided by Optimality Theory grammars (Prince and Smolensky 1993, 2004) or grammars in the principles-and-parameters framework (Chomsky 1981, Dresher and Kaye 1990, Gibson and Wexler 1994). Not only does the noncounting nature of nonlocal dependencies automatically follow from the way the learner generalizes, it also explains the absence of blocking patterns from the typology. Finally, the learner lends support to the idea that long-distance phonotactic patterns are phenomenologically distinct from spreading patterns, contra the hypothesis of Strict Locality (Gafos 1999, et seq.).},

However, if the L2 has a greater degree of contrast than the L1 then either the extra degree(s) of contrast will be lost, or the L1 must introduce markedness into its phonological system. The objective of this article is twofold. First, I argue that the introduction of markedness into the L1's phonology when adapting words from another language correlates with the social relation- ship between the languages. I demonstrate this by examining the retention of phonemic contrast in the various stages of the adaptation of Chinese words into Japanese. Second, I argue for a phonological constraint that enforces the retention of L2's phonemic contrast, DISTINCT. An Optimality Theoretic analysis of the adaptation of Sino-Japanese produces the expected results for all of stages of adaptation except one\textemdash{}the stage when contact between the two languages is at its peak. For this stage, the analysis requires the addition of the DISTINCT constraint.},

This agreement is subject to certain restrictions resembling the Person-Case Constraint paradigm (Bonet 1991). Moreover, there is a cor- relation between agreement restrictions and conditions on (the obviation of) noun- incorporation in Southern Tiwa, as explicitly and elegantly captured by Rosen (1990) in terms of a heterogeneous feature hierarchy and rules of association. We attempt to recast Rosen's central insights in terms of Anagnostopoulou's probe-sharing model of Person-Case Constraint effects (Anagnostopoulou 2003, 2006), to show that the full range of Southern Tiwa agreement and (non-)incorporation restrictions can be given a single, unified analysis within the probe-goal-Agree framework of Chomsky (2001). In particular, we argue that Southern Tiwa's triple-agreement system is characterized by (a) an independent class probe located on the heads T and v, and (b) a rule that allows this class probe to be deleted in the context of local-person T- agreement. The various restrictions on agreement and non-incorporation then reduce to a single source: failure of class-valuation with DP (as opposed to NP) arguments.},

  title = {Bidirectional {{Case}}-{{Marking}} and {{Linear Adjacency}}},
  volume = {25},
  abstract = {Bidirectional case markers in West African languages, including those of the Songhay family, are morphemes inserted between subject and object NPs that would otherwise be adjacent. They therefore specify both that the NP to the left is a subject, and that the NP to the right is an object, and they cannot be bracketed uniquely with either. This is shown by the fact that these morphemes are absent when either subject or object position is (structurally and phonologically) absent, for example due to extraction. This is the only morphological case-marking in the relevant languages. The operation inserting such morphemes must have reference to constituent structure (NP), abstract case (subject, object), and linear adjacency. These data increase the evidence that complex case-marking operations can apply in a centrally located morphology component that has simultaneous access to categorial and linear relations. The idea is questionable that such morphological operations take place at a syntax/PF interface, where syntactic categories are first aligned with prosodic phrases, since actual prosodic (e.g. accentual) bracketings do not always coincide with the bracketings relevant to case morphology. This point is made with data from Tamashek (Berber) nominal prefix alternations, preceding the main section on Songhay case marking.},

  volume = {35},
  abstract = {This article outlines an account of the syntax of existential constructions (e.g., $\backslash$emphThere are too many problems) based on a view of the postcopular NP as a predicate. This NP figures as the predicate in an embedded clausal complement of $\backslash$emphbe with expletive $\backslash$emphthere as its subject. $\backslash$emphThere consequently moves to the higher Spec, IP position for Case-theoretic reasons. Existential constructions and existential interpretation are a particular instance of a wider phenomenon involving the use of predicates of various categories with expletive subjects (e.g., $\backslash$emphIt is cold). Long-distance agreement between the main (inflected) verb and the postcopluar NP is a combined effect of the relation of subject-predicate agreement holding between the expletive subject ($\backslash$emphthere) and a predicate NP within the embedded clausal structure and the relation of specifier-head agreement (feature checking) bewteen the arised expletive and the matrix I/T. This analysis is generalized to other cases of long-distance agreement (e.g., $\backslash$emphThere appeared a man). It is shown that an analysis based on teh notion $\backslash$emphAgree (Chomsky 2000) is empirically inadequate. Well-known restrictions on the distribution of NPs/DPs in existential constructions follow from the proposed analysis.},

Cultural identity, the orientation of the speaker to the community, was first observed in variationist work by Labov (1963) but has not been regularly analyzed as have sex, age, and ethnicity. Cultural identity is postulated as a speaker's orientation to the local and larger regional cultures, and in Warren County, North Carolina, this orientation correlates strongly with vernacular variants of present and past tense be. For copula absence (e.g. They real nice people), was regularization (e.g. We was going), and past tense wont (e.g. We wont gonna go), the cultural identity of the speaker had statistically significant effects on language variation. To understand language variation in this community, the interactions of cultural identity and other external variables must be considered.},

  volume = {39},
  abstract = {The study of phonotactics is a central topic in phonology. We propose a theory of phonotactic grammars and a learning algorithm that constructs such grammars from positive evidence. Our grammars consist of constraitns that are assigned numerical weights according to the principle of maximum entropy. The grammars assess possible words on the basis of the weighted sum of their constraint violations. The learning algorithm yields grammars that can capture both categorical and gradient phonotactic patterns. The algorithm is not provided with constraints in advance, but uses its own resources to form constraints and weight them. A baseline model, in which Universal Grammar is reduced to a feature set and an SPE-style constraint format, suffices to learn many phonotactic phenomena. In order for the model to learn nonlocal phenomena such as stress and vowel harmony, it must be augmented with autosegmental tiers and metrical grids. Our results thus offer novel, learning-theoretic support for such representations. We apply the model in a variety of learning simulations, showing that the learned grammars capture the distributional generalizations of these languages and accurately predict the findings of a phonotactic experiment.},

We argue that the Bengali facts support a typology of intonational tones that includes only pitcha ccents and boundary tones, and that the docking sites for boundary tones are the phrase edges provided under the theory of the Prosodic Hierarchy (Selkirk 1980). We show that Bengali intonational contours are governed by the Obligatory Contour Principle (OCP), which forbids adjacent identical tones. Underlying contours that violate the OCP are converted to permissible surface forms by a phonological rule. We also bring Bengali data to bear on a long-standing controversy concerning phrasal stress: Bengali can be shown to have a default, phonologically assigned phrasal stress pattern; thus phrasal stress assignment cannot be reduced exclusively to focus and other semantic factors.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates the syntax and semantics of the Japanese com- parative construction that utilizes yori `than', which functionally corresponds to the English more-comparative. While endorsing Beck et al.'s (J East Asian Linguist 13: 289\textendash{}344, 2004) general claim that yori-comparatives cannot be analyzed on a par with the English comparative, the paper points out the problems associated with their analysis. Among the points the paper maintains in contrast with Beck et al. (J East Asian Linguist 13: 289\textendash{}344, 2004) are (i) the denotation of the complement of yori is a degree, an individual, or a proposition, and (ii) yori-phrases take a gradable predicate as their argument; thus yori-phrases participate in the semantic composition of the matrix clause. In describing the difference between English and Japanese regarding the phenomena involving gradable predicates, the paper advocates Snyder et al.'s (Proceedings of the Thirteenth West Coast Conference on Formal Linguistics, 1994) hypothesis that AdjPs in Japanese lack the specifier position that hosts a degree variable or constant (cf. Fukui, A theory of category projection and its applications. Doctoral dissertation, 1986), dispensing with Beck et al.'s Degree Abstraction Parameter.},

The results are based on an analysis of rhoticity and /r/-sandhi in the speech of New Zealanders born between 1860 and 1925, dates that encompass the formative years of New Zealand English. The results demonstrate that the /r/- sandhi system in New Zealand English emerged gradually and overlapped with the decline of rhoticity. This is a significant advance on previous descriptive work on this topic and provides results that should both inform and constrain potential phonological theories of /r/-sandhi.},

  title = {What {{Constrains Possible Suffix Combinations}}? {{On}} the {{Interaction}} of {{Grammatical}} and {{Processing Restrictions}} in {{Derivational Morphology}}},
  volume = {22},
  abstract = {There is a long-standing debate about the principles and mchanisms that constrain the combinatorial properties of affixes, in particular of English suffixes. One group of scholars argues for the existence of lexical strata with strong restrictions holding between the different strata. This view is disputed by scholars who claim that it is selectional restrictions of individual suffixes that are responsible for hte combinatorial properties of suffixes. Most recently, Hay (2000, 2002) has proposed a psycholinguistic model of morphological complexity, according to which an affix whihc can be easily parsed out in processing should not occur inside an affix which cannot. This model has been called "complexity based ordering". The general claim is that affixes can be approximately ordered along a hierarchy of complexity, with more spearable affixes at one end, and less sparable affixes at the other end. More separable affixes can attach outside less separable affixes, but not vice-versa. The goal of this paper is to test the predicionts of complexity based ordering hrough an investigation of 15 English suffixes and their potential 210 two-suffix combinations. Using large data-bases such as the British National Corpus, the CELES lexical database, the OED and the internet, we investigate whether the attested and non-attested combinations are best explained by complexity based ordering or by the individual selectional properteis of these sufixes. We show that in most cases selectional restrictions and parsing restrictions coincide. Where sleectional restrictions underdeterine possible combinations, complexity based ordering makes correct predictions. Only easily parsable combinations are possible combinations, and this range of possible combinations is then further curtailed by selectional restrictions. In sum, we argue that both selecitonal restrictions and parsing constraints are instrumental in determining possible and impossible suffix combinations.},

In this article, I argue that these issues are not nearly as problematic as they might first appear. The article demonstrates that Banawa's onset sensitivity can be produced by a constraint aligning the head syllables off eet with onsets, that its minimal word restriction can be produced with Nonfinality constraints, and that it can maintain syllable integrity simply by giving clash and lapse avoidance priority over other footing considerations.},

  title = {Acquisition of {{Malagasy Voicing System}}: {{Implications}} for the {{Adult Grammar}}},
  volume = {24},
  abstract = {In this paper we discuss the acquisition of the voicing system of Malagasy, an Austronesian language. Our study is based on the longitudinal data of three children ages 19\textendash{}32 months, and is to our knowledge the first systematic investigation of the acquisition of Malagasy. The Malagasy voicing system has a distinctive morphology and involves the promotion of an argument (actor, theme, instrument, etc.) to a referentially and syntactically prominent position, typically clause-final.We look at two competing accounts of the Malagasy voicing system, one in which the promoted argument is analyzed as a subject and the promotion operation an instance of A-movement (Guilfoyle, Hung, \& Travis, 1992) and a more recent account in which Malagasy is analyzed as a V2-like language in which the promoted argument is a topic and the promotion an instance of A -movement (Pearson, M. (2001); Pearson, M. (2005)). Both analyses have clear implications for acquisition, which we examine in this paper. Our acquisition results favor the analysis of the promoted argument as an A -element. We also show that there is a developmental stage in Malagasy that parallels the root infinitive (RI) stage widely observed in various European languages. Apparent differences between the Germanic RIs and the analogous phenomenon in Malagasy are derived from differences in the functional structure associated with a voicing system as opposed to an agreement system.},

I discuss the role that event structure, aspect and modality play in the interpretation of these clauses. The basic hypothesis is that in the absence of a tense specificaiton, the temporal reference of non-finite clauses is determined by the event structure of the predicate, in particular by the property of event closure. General principles of aspectual interpretation, such as the Puctuality Constraint (Giorgi and Pianesi 1997) and the Default Anchoring Requirement (a special case of a broader requirement that all clauses be temporally interpreted) interact with the particular aspectual features of hte target langauge to explain the cross-linguistic differences in the temporal interpretation (past/present/modal) non-finite clauses.},

I propose that the Stem Parameter, which states that a stem is/is not a well-formed word int he langauge, is set early, and that a positive vs. negative setting directly affects the timing and manner in which children acquire inflectional morphemes. Related to this, I propose that the distinction between core and peripheral grammar (Chomsky 1981) provides a complexity metric for grammatical development.},

First, the order of sounds resulting from metathesis can differ from language to language such that a similar combination of sounds can be realized in one order in one language, but in the reverse order in another language. Second, for some sound combinations, only one order is commonly attested as the result of metathesis, while for other combinations, either order can be observed. Third, the acoustic/auditory cues to the identification of the sequence resulting from metathesis are often bettern than those of the expected, yet nonoccurring, order. These patterns receive a straightforward explanation when we consider the phonetic nature of the sounds ivolved as well as the speaker/hearer's knowledge of native sound patterns and their frequency of occurrence. Neither factor alone is sufficient to provide a predictive account of metathesis. This study shows, however, that by taking into account both factors, we are able to understand why certain soundn combinations tend to undergo metathesis, why others are common results of metathesis, why patterns of metathesis differ across languages, and importantly, why metathesis occurs in the first place.},

We present a new test from extraposition facts that distinguishes between the raising and matching structures for relative clauses. Furthermore, this paper presents an account of the semantics of raising relative clauses which is intended to complete the picture of the semantics of relative clauses. In particular, we argue that raising relative clauses are not islands for Quantifier Raising (QR) and that in these clauses there is successive cyclic movement through a CP-adjoined position.},

We argue that these divergences reflect a real dichotomy between unbounded dependencies with fillers in A(rgument) positions, e.g. 'tough' constructions, and those whose fillers occupy non-argument (A-bar) positions, e.g. topicalization. We first show that strong external evidence exists supporting the GPSG-internal prediction of full syntactic connectivity between A-position fillers and their gap sites, but that this result seems contradicted by the existence of case conflict between the filler and gap. To overcome this contradiction, we introduce a new gap-licensing feature GAP, and show how a number of other divergences between A- and A-bar filler/gap constructions follow as a consequence.},

It distinguishes three general approaches to the analysis of wanna: a phonological rule, lexicalization, or a derivational rule. Each approach has a different set of strengths, but they all have weaknesses as well. The article then offers a new analysis in terms of REALIZATION, which combines the strengths of all the previous analyses. This analysis, which is based on the theory of word grammar, accounts not only for all the well-known syntactic and morphological constraints on this contraction, but also for a fact that has not been noted before: that, for some speakers, the last vowel alternates in just the same idiosyncratic way as that of to, which suggests strongly that in some sense wanna contains to as well as want. For these (but not all) speakers, the proposed analysis recognizes two words (sublexemes of WANT and TOinf) at the level of syntax and a single form ( wanna , containing variants of want and to ) at the level of form; the relations between these words and forms, and between the forms and their phonological realizations, are defined by a declarative network.},

If there is a tie, the first segment gets linked by temporal sequence. V-neutralization (Chung 1996) turns mid vowels into high when they form rimes with the adjacent vowels. (e) The contracted form abides by Maximality (Prince 1985) to construct the largest possible syllable. (f) In addition, stress is shown irrelevant, and phonotactic constrainst may be contravened.},

This paper employs the diagnostic tool Replace (X) to examine the sub- syllabic constituency in Old Chinese (OC) by virtue of two types of directional reduplication data: progressive and retrogressive reduplication. This paper finds that the OC syllable is comprised of onset, nucleus, and rhyme, which have different representations in the syllable structure. This paper also argues that the OC tone should be represented in terms of another independent plane, i.e., adjoining to the whole syllable rather than the rhyme sub-syllabic constituent, on the basis of the rhyming in Shijing `Book of Odes'. The OC medial glides -j- and -w- show an asymmetric status in syllable structure. The former tends to be aligned with the rhyme, while the latter tends to be aligned with onset. Comparing with other OC syllable structures, it is found that theoretical analyses reveal certain aspects of sub-syllabic processes, such as the placements of medial glides, and help us to examine syllabic representations such as tone representation, all of which may not be detected by direct observation of a maximal syllable in OC. Furthermore, a comparison of syllable structures in OC and Middle Chinese suggests that syllable structure, as well as other phonological phenomena, underwent great changes from OC to Middle Chinese or Guangyun phonology.},

  volume = {18},
  abstract = {This study examines young children's production of head-final relative clauses (RCs) in Chinese. Three different hypotheses (the Canonical Word Order Hypothesis, the Filler-gap Linear Distance Hypothesis, and the Structural Distance Hypothesis) have been proposed to account for the subject\textendash{}object asymmetry found in children's performance with head-initial RCs in English. The structure of Chinese head-final RCs is minimally different from that of English head-initial RCs and thus provides an ideal case to examine the effect of different factors that are confounded in English. Our findings fail to support the Canonical Word Order Hypothesis and the Filler-gap Linear Distance Hypothesis. Instead, we suggest that it is the gap position in the hierarchical structure that affects children's production performance with subject-gapped and object-gapped RCs. Our findings also suggest that Mandarin Chinese does not belong to the group of East Asian languages which has been argued to have an acquisition pattern for RCs that is different from the one found in European languages. In addition, the cross-linguistic comparison of production errors suggests that the occurrence of the head noun in the sequential order of the production string affects the type of errors children make during the sentence production process.},

In contrast to the diachronic account presented in Li (1977), which assumes, based on cognate comparison among Rukai dialects, that Maga mid vowels derive historically from Proto Rukai, the current work draws evidence from alternations found in Maga and proposes that the mid vowels are not inherited nor underlyingly present but are surface variants of high vowels., generated by synchronic processes. Two other phenomena, echo vowel insertion and $\backslash$emphe r/o v alternation, are examined in connection with mid vowel formation. It is shown in the discussion that the proposed synchronic approach not only provides an answer to soem unresolved issues related to Maga mid vowels, thus shedding light on our understanding of Maga's vocalic inventories, but also reveals the interactions among various processes and hence offers insight into the unified mechanisms that tie together the alternations in the language.},

In this article, I will propose that there are two types of stylistic fronting, stylistic fronting of XPs into FocusP-Spec and stylistic fronting of heads into Focus . Stylistic fronting of XPs can only be found in clauses with no overt subject, whereas stylistic fronting of heads can be found both in clauses with no overt subject and in clauses with a weak subject pronoun.},

  abstract = {We challenge the predominant view of the English dative alternation, which takes all alternating verbs to have two meanings: a caused possession meaning realized by the double object variant and a caused motion meaning realized by the to variant. Instead, we argue that verbs like give and sell only have a caused possession meaning, while verbs like throw and send have both caused motion and caused possession meanings. We show that the caused possession meaning may be realized by both variants. Concomitantly, we argue that verbs like give, even in the to variant, lack a conceptual path constituent, and instead have a caused possession meaning which can be understood as the bringing about of a `have' relation. We reassess evidence for alternative approaches adduced from inference patterns and verb\textendash{}argument combinations and demonstrate how our verb-sensitive analysis, when combined with an account of variant choice, provides a more insightful explanation of this data, while having wider coverage. Our investigation affirms proposals that a verb's own meaning plays a key role in determining its argument realization options. To conclude, we consider the crosslinguistic implications of our study, attempting to explain why so many languages lack a true dative alternation.},

The role of some standard distinctions found in the literature is weakened or put in a new perspective. The distinction between universal and existential is no longer an intrinsic property of FCIs. Similarly, the opposition between variation-based vs intension-based analyses is relativized. We show that the regime of free choiceness can be characterized by an abstract constraint, that we call Non-Individuation (NI), and which can be satisfied in different ways that match current distinctions. NI says that the information conveyed by a sentence containing a FCI should not be reducible to a referential situation, that is a situation in which particular individuals satisfy the sentence in the current world. The widely used resource of modal variation becomes a particular scenario of free-choiceness, not its `essence'. In fact, we show that under certain conditions, FCIs can occur in episodic, non-modal sentences, a fact that NI can accommodate. We also discuss more fine-grained aspects of the semantics of FCIs, such as their emotional colour.},

  volume = {8},
  abstract = {This paper argues for the hypothesis of direct compositionality (as in, e.g. Montague 1974), according to which the combinatory syntactic rules specify a set of well-formed expressions while the semantic combinatory rules work in tandem to directly supply a model-theoretic interpretation to each expression as it is "built" in teh syntax. (This thus obviates the need for any level like LF and, concomitatnly, for any rules mapping surface structures to such a level.) I focus here on one related group of phenomena: the interaction of "paycheck" pronouns iwth Weak Crossover effects and i-within-i effects. These interactions were studied in Jacobson (1977) as they show up in Bach-Peters sentences. There I argued that these interactions show that paycheck pronouns have a complex representation at LF; here I show that all of the observations in this earlier work are compatible with the hypothesis of direct compositionality. The key tool is the adoption of a variation-free semantics (a semantics which makes no use of variables as part of the semantic machinery). IN addition to the gneeral consequences for the syntax/semantics interface, there are two other main results. First, I proivde new arguments for a variable-free semantics. For example, it will be shown that under this view the paycheck reading of a pronoun comes for free; most other theories posit additional mechanisms and/or an additional lexical meaning for pronouns, and thus paycheck and regular pronouns are only accidentally homophonous. Second, I reiterate one of the central points in Jacobson (1977): this is that the first pronoun in a Bach-Peters sentence is indeed a paycheck pronoun, and hence nothing special needs to be said about these sentences nor does any new machinery need to be invoked for them.},

  abstract = {Our intent here,in the face of a persistent tradition of studying control in purely syntactic terms,is to reiterate the fundamental importance of semantics in the control problem, and to articulate some of the semantic factors more precisely than has heretofore been possible. After presenting familiar obstacles to a theory of control based on syntactic binding,we make a threeway distinction between `unique control' (usually called OBLIGATORY CONTROL),`free control', and `nearly free control' (the last two falling under traditional NONOBLIGATORY CONTROL). We show that in a very large class of cases of unique control,the controlled VP denotes an action and the controller is the character who has the onus for that action. This analysis is applied to four major classes of control verbs and their nominals,as well as a class of adjectives,showing that semantic role reliably identifies the controller,and syntactic position does not. Through a formalization in terms of CONCEPTUAL STRUCTURE,we begin to be able to explain much of control directly from the lexical decomposition of the matrix verb. Several classes of exceptions to the conditions on unique control are treated as cases of coercion,in which extra conventionalized semantic material is added that is not present in syntax.},

This mixture of regularity and idiosyncrasy lends itself to an account in the spirit of construction grammar, in which the lexicon includes specified syntactic structures matched with meanings. The internal syntactic structure of NPN violates standard principles of phrase structure, and the required identity of the two nouns (in most cases) presents descriptive difficulties. Furthermore, when NPN appears in NP positions, it can take normal NP complements and modifiers, and it has quantificational semantics despite the absence of a lexical quantifier. These peculiarities collectively present interesting challenges to linguistic theory. The best hope lies in a theory of grammar that (i) recognizes meaningful constructions as theoretical entities; (ii) recognizes a continuum of regularity between words and rules; and (iii) recognizes the autonomy of syntax from semantics and vice versa.},

Additional data from a wide range of languages further supports the conclusion that polarity-type changes are not unidirectional. The observed changes are analyzed in terms of lexical underspecification theory as the result of one of only two possible diachronic operations: introduction of a plus-valued feature or complete loss of a feature in the lexical entries of the respective indefinites.},

It is shown that the semantic functions for motion and extent senses, respectively GO and GOext, are distinct, but that they share a great deal of internal structure. While both functions express successive transition from one component state to the next, they differ in (a) the presence vs. absence of the passage of time, and (b) the identity of the mover through transition. The analysis presented here based on semantic functions comes closer to an overall characterization of the motion/extent contrast than the image-schema-based approach (Lakoff 1987) or the metaphor-based approach (Lakoff \& Turner 1989). It can also be easily extended to account for types of extent sentences that the literature has not focussed upon.},

The main claim is that the honorific form of verbs actually consists of separate morphemes, which include honorific prefixes, verb stems, nominalisation suffixes, and light verbs. We further argue that the honorific prefix o-, which has been generally disregarded in previous literature, is a functional category which heads its own projection. The proposed analysis solves a long-standing problem in the investigation of Japanese honorific constructions, as to why honorific verbs cannot be separated from light verbs, originally pointed out by Harada (1976). Furthermore, this analysis shows how the syntactic distinction between the light verbs naru and suru leads to the meaning difference between the subject-honorific and object-honorific constructions.},

  volume = {14},
  abstract = {Takayama (1999) recently proposed a new rendaku-based vocabulary stratum hierarchy for Japanese, in which what he terms a vulgarized Sino-Japanese stratum is treated separately from, and occupies a more core position than, the traditional Sino-Japanese (SJ) stratum. However, Takayama deliberately excludes from his analysis one particular subset of the SJ vocabulary layer, monomorphemic SJ lexemes (SJ mononoms), and focuses exclusively on bimorphemic SJ lexemes (SJ binoms), claiming that analytical difficulties caused by another voicing phenomenon known as shindaku(Okumura (1952)), which occurs only in the SJ stratum, hampers any attempt to ascertain the frequency of rendaku amongst SJ mononoms. As it has been established that the stratum to which the initial element in a dual element noun compound belongs is not a factor conditioning rendaku in the second element (Ohno (2000)), examining comparatively under-researched hybrid noun compounds whose second element is a SJ mononom allows us to bypass any interference caused by shindakuand establish the frequency of rendaku occurrence amongst SJ mononoms. Such a corpus of hybrid noun compounds whose second element is a SJ mononom is presented here, to the authors knowledge the first time any such corpus has appeared in print, an analysis of which shows that rendaku is in fact more than twice as likely to occur amongst SJ mononoms as amongst SJ binoms. When a further dynamic, the faithfulness of SJ mononoms to a prosodic size factor proposed by Rosen (2001) for native Japanese lexemes, is taken into consideration, it is clear that not only, at the very least, must Takayamas vulgarized SJ stratum be amended to incorporate SJ mononoms, but that there is also a strong case for proposing an independent vulgarized SJ mononom stratum occupying an even more central position than the vulgarized SJ binom stratum.},

  volume = {11},
  abstract = {In thi sarticle, I propose a semantic account of termporally mismatched past subjunctive counterfactuals. The proposal consists of the following parts. First, I show that in cases of temporal mismatch, [past] cannot be interpreted inside the proposition where it occurs at surface structure. In stead, it must be interpreted as constraining the time argument of the accessibility relation. This has the effect of shifting the time of the evaluation of the conditional to some contexturally salient past time. Second, I will propose specific felicity conditions (presuppositions) for subjunctive conditionsals and I will argue that there is a strict correspondence between the time of evaluation in the truth conditions of a conditiional and the time relevant for the felicity conditions. In other words, if the time relevant for the accessibility relation has been shifted to the past, then the conditional's presupposition will make reference to a past context. On the other hand, if no past is constraining the time argument of the accessibility relation, the conditional's felicity will make reference to the current (main) context. Third, I will argue that the intuation that the antecedent of mismatche counterfactuals is not true is a scalar implicature arising from a competition not between assertions but between presuppositions. Finally, I will investigate the repercussions of my proposal for hte general theory of modality.},

Recently proposed, although not as yet independently evaluated, has been a prosodic size rule governing the well-known allomorphic phenomenon of rendaku, by which the initial consonants of non-initial elements in compounds may be voiced under certain conditions. It is claimed that this prosodic size rule flags a native Japanese noun as being rendaku immune, a condition for which no empirical verification has hitherto existed. In this paper the author will demonstrate that, although slight modifications are necessary, a prosodic size rule for flagging rendaku immunity is indeed a reality.},

In turn, these differences are shown to correlate with what type of object is denoted by the phrase in the scope of the particle. The proposal has repercussions also for the focus-sensitive particle again.

Support for this view of specificity comes from the behavior of indefinite this in spoken English, as well as from specificity markers in Samoan, Hebrew, and Sissala. It is shown that the conditions on the use of this-indefinites cannot be accounted for by previous analyses of specificity. The relationship between definiteness and specificity in article systems crosslinguistically is examined, and a distinction between presuppositions and felicity conditions is argued for. Additional evidence for the reality of specificity comes from a study of article choice in the English of adult second language learners (whose L1s, Russian and Korean, lack articles). It is shown that the learners' errors are tied to specificity: they consist largely of overuse of the in specific indefinite contexts, and overuse of a in non-specific definite contexts. It is concluded that specificity is a universal semantic distinction, which receives morphological expression crosslinguistically and is available to second language learners.},

The framework is that of Chomsky (2001), assuming Agree, hence not assuming obligatory spec-head agreement with covert movement to check phi-features or Case.

Since Finnish observes the Extended Projection Principle and has an expletive pronoun, Hypothesis A predicts that null subjects should cooccur with expletives. The prediction is false, favoring B over A. A typology of null subjects is proposed: Null bound pronouns and null generic pronouns in partial null subject languages, including Finnish, are D-less Ps, and so are null subjects in consistent null subject languages with Agr, such as Spanish and Greek.

Restrictions on the surface realization of either result from a linear precedence rule ordering either before the contrastive focus, language particular constraints on word order, and general constraints on coordinate ellipsis. Overall, this analysis presents an account of either . . . or constructions that introduces only a single linear precedence rule and a licensing construction for combining either with disjunctions to account for the data, relying on independently-motivated constraints to carry the rest of the analytical burden.},

  abstract = {This article investigates genitive compounds, a special type of NN compound found in West Frisian and some other languages/dialects on the North Sea littoral. Genitive compounds show a number of properties distinguishing them from normal NN compounds, the most striking of which is the obligatory definiteness/specificity of their first element and, as a consequence, of the compound as a whole. These properties can be accounted for if genitive compounds are analyzed as phrases moving towards word status. Historically they derive from the Old Frisian prenominal genitive construction, and it is shown that they still are a kind of prenominal genitive construction today, albeit heavily lexicalized, i.e., subject to lexical principles and containing specifically lexical elements. Since some of the phrasal elements in genitive compounds do not occur in syntax proper and since their definiteness produces a blocking effect on normal NN compounds, they seem to provide evidence for the concept of lexical phrases, potentially productive phrasal patterns in the lexicon.},

I will claim that impersonal pronouns are the pronominal counterpart of generic DPs and, like these, definite, but non-specific. Further, it will be argued that the most important typological distinction with impersonal pronouns, viz. that between inclusive and exclusive, is a consequence of their non-specificity. With respect to Modern West Frisian men I will contend that this element, in addition to being a genuine (weak) impersonal pronoun, can be a (strong) quasi-personal pronoun. I will provide some further evidence for this subclass of impersonal pronouns and show how its existence is predicted by my general theory of impersonal pronouns.},

Some advantages of the covert incorporation proposal are sketched, including two applications outside the area of polarity licensing: adverbial modification by approximative adverbs, and emphatic reduplication.},

Weist, Wysocka, and Lyytinen (1991) for English and Finnish, and Van Hout (1997, 1998b) for English and Dutch have shown that children up to age 6;06 allow simple telic predicates to have both telic and atelic interpretations. The main objective of this article is to show that children aged 3;09 allow locatum structures to be interpreted as telic, like adults, but allow simple telic predicates to have telic and atelic interpretations. The central claim is that in simple telic predicates, telicity is checked by covert movement, while in locatum predicates, telicity is checked by overt movement. Children misinterpret simple telic predicates because covert movement is an operation that takes place after the branching off to the PF component, but perform like adults when overt movement is involved.},

Sentence (1) has a reading in which there is some three-year interval in the past during which Mary lived in Amsterdam, and a reading in which Mary lives in Amsterdam at speech time and has done so for the three years preceding speech time. I will argue that this ambiguity is also present in sentences in the simple tenses, and that a unified treatment of for (as well as other temporal adverbials) is possible once it is recognised that temporal adverbials are interpreted differently depending on their syntactic position. Rather than attributing the ambiguity of such sentences to lexical ambiguity of the adverbial, I argue that the interpretation of a sentence with a temporal adverbial is affected by the partition of the sentence into two portions which are interpreted as parts of different semantic correlates, much like Topic/ Comment and Background/Focus constructions.},

Thus we present support for Baker's (1989) insight of the Double-Headedness and against Collins' (1997) VP-shell structure with a pro. This kind of empirical evidence is not available in other languages (cf.

The nature of the DoC has long been discussed in the literature since Harada's work back in the 1970's, but it has eluded a principled explanation. The DoC has been known to apply to certain domains and a careful study presented in this article shows that these domains correspond to phases. Thus, the DoC reduces to a PF constraint against realizing multiple occurrences of the accusative Case value within a single Spell-Out domain. Specifically, I argue that the DoC applies cyclically phase-by-phase and thus that the DoC provides solid evidence for the cyclic phase-based computation in the current minimalist theorizing (Chomsky 2001, 2004, 2008). If correct, Case in Japanese has two facets: a Case is valued in narrow syntax but its value is only realized at Spell-Out, at which point PF interface conditions apply. It is further suggested that the DoC reduces to a syntactic OCP (Obligatory Contour Principle). The DoC, therefore, is considered to be a case in which an apparently language-particular and hence peripheral phenomenon provides empirical support for the architecture of the Universal Grammar.},

Recent minimalist research has sought to eliminate the binding theory from UG by reducing its conditions to narrow-syntactic operations (Hornstein 200, 2006; Reuland 2001, 2006; Kayne 2002; Zwart 2002, 2006; Hicks 2006). This approach remains controversial since the canonical minimalist binding theory (Chomsky 1993; Chomsky and Lasnik 1993) views the binding conditions as interpretive reules applying at LF, supported by evidence that condition A interacts with other interpretive phenomena assumed to be determined at LF (Lebeaux 1998; Fox and Nissenbaum 2004). While the interaction of anaphor binding and scope relations in particular is not disputed, I show that it is attributable to factors outside the binding theory, namely the requirement that variables (including anaphors) must be c-commanded by their binders at LF. Deprived of its strongest empirical argument, the LF binding theory can then be picked apart.},

This article argues that the phase-based implementation of the Minimalist Program (Chomsky 2000, 2001, 2004) permits a reanalysis of null wh-operators capable of circumventing the previous theoretical difficulties. Essentially, tough-movement consists of A-moving a constituent out of a ``complex'' null operator that has already undergone A'-movement, a ``smuggling'' construction in the terms proposed by Collins (2005a,b).},

This article provides an account for an apprent anomaly: the relatively free occurrence of bare noun phrases under coordination. We argue that this construction involves coordination of projections below the DP level, with the coordinated structure subsequently raising to Spec,DP. Our analysis accounts for the fact that these nominals are endowed with uniqueness conditions, but only in soem casesk, and for a number of other hitherto undocumented fact, including complex constraints on modification.},

The exact status of these phenomena in contemporary Faroese, a language that has been argued to be undergoing syntactic change, is a matter of dispute; we attempt to clarify this using the methodology of Magnitude Estimation (ME). We extend what is known by presenting the results of a systematic comparison of judgment data from Icelandic (where the finite verb obligatorily moves to a high position within the clause, and embedded V2 has been claimed to be possible quite generally), Danish (where the finite verb obligatorily remains in a low position, and embedded V2 has been claimed to be restricted), and Faroese (where the status of verb movement is precisely at issue, and the availability of embedded V2 has been little explored).},

In place of unconscious rule following Searle posits what he calls the Background, comprised of nonintentional (nonrepresentational) mental phenomena. I argue that these two aspects of his philosophy of language cannot be reconciled. In order to preserve his view of language as a rule-governed activity, he must embrace the cognitivist idea of unconscious rule following.

Several complex constructions are also examiend and it is shown that their unusual behavior with respect to stress can be explained in a straightforward manner thourhg the prosodic hierarchy if their syntactic structures are taken into account and different edge settings are allowed at different levels of the prosodic hierarchy.`},

The problems this phenomenon poses for phonology still need to be treated, however, and the extent to which function word contractions set the stage for the evolution of inflected function words from simple cliticization remains to be explored. This paper first addresses issues with regard to the prosodic representation of function word sequences preceding lexical words (i.e., [Fnc Fnc Lex]). Investigating such contractions in a number of German dialects, it will be shown that a sequence of Fnc Fnc constitutes a special phonological unit of its own, which is arguably a trochaic foot that adjoins to the neighboring prosodic word. It will be argued that this analysis accounts for several phonological processes that are peculiar to function word contractions, and also predicts phonological fusion in which the second function word is reduced. Second, the paper suggests that the phonological fusion of function words sets the stage for a number of diachronic processes such as reanalysis and analogical extension, which arguably lead to the evolution of paradigms of inflected function words.},

English learners at 4.5 and 10 months of age gave evidence of observing both markedness and faithfulness constraints and ranked markedness above faithfulness. After a brief instability around 15 months, at 20 months they display the adult English pattern, with markedness outranking faithfulness.},

Based on quantitative data, we propose that the underlying tone of pitch accent is H*+L and that the left edge of a prosodic word is marked by a low boundary tone (\%L). Our observation, with respect to the tone interaction of different lexical classes, shows evidence in favor of the downstep/ upstep account [Kenstowicz \& Sohn (1997) Focus and phrasing in Northern Kyungsang Korean. In P.-M. Bertinetto (Ed.), Certamen Phonologicum III, (pp. 137\textendash{}156). Torino: Rosenberg and Sellier. (Also in MIT Working Papers in Linguistics, 30, 25\textendash{}47, 1997)], as opposed to the H-tone deletion account (e.g., G. Kim (1988) The Pitch-accent System of the Taegu Dialect of Korean with Emphasis on Tone Sandhi at the Phrasal Level, PhD dissertation, University of Hawaii.). The data also indicate that surface representations of NKK are sparsely specified for tone. Most importantly, we found that the prosodic cue of focus differs depending on the location of the pitch accent within a prosodic word. We conclude that the prosodic goal of focus in NKK is in the pitch range expansion of the focused phrase, which is implemented by expanding the pitch range of the most prominent word within the phrase, regardless of whether it is the focused word or not.},

This indicates that the optionality of $\backslash$emphha depends on more than one factor. In constructions with modal verbs, hte head that is spelled out as $\backslash$emphha can be present or absent in both languages. That is, the optionality of $\backslash$emphha is connected to the optionality of generating the relevant head. In Swedish, there is the additional possibility of generating $\backslash$emphha without spelling it out. More precisely, $\backslash$emphha need not be spelled out if $\backslash$emphha shares its features with some element that is overtly realized. Still, ther eis much variation between speakers of Swedish concerning the distribution of optional $\backslash$emphha.

In this paper I examine data from Scandinavian, and English to some extent, and argue that both options are made available by the theory but they are not available in all languages. I present an analysis which examines the interaction between verb movement and subject Case-checking and claim that Spec-TP is only available in languages with overt verb raising to T. In those languages Spec-TP is available as a Case checking position for the subject in finite clauses and also as an intermediate position in non-finite clauses (complements of raising verbs and ECM [accusative with Infinitive] verbs) where the subject can check the EPP feature of a non-finite clause but not check its Case. In this sense the paper suggests a refinement of checking theory with respect to subjects.},

  volume = {25},
  abstract = {This paper argues that the phenomenon of noun incorporation in Inuktitut derives from the fact that the set of verbs involved are all light verbs in the sense of being functional elements excluding lexical or root material. Verbs found in noun incorporation in Inuktitut are in little v and syntactically Merge with a nominal root complement. A parameter which requires that the first root must syntactically move to the top of the tree results in the leftmost position of the root and its apparent incorporation. Unlike Mohawk, where classical noun incorporation is a result of argument licensing, Inuktitut noun incorporation is a subset of a general syntactic operation which targets roots. The light verb analysis of noun incorporation predicts that the set of verbs found in noun incorporation are a finite class with a restricted and predictable semantic range. It is further proposed that obligatory noun incorporation universally involves light verbs. Data in support of this claim are shown from Wakashan and Chukchi. In contrast to a grammaticalized account of this class of verbs, it is argued that these light verbs are universally available as elementary syntactic components. Thus, the limited range and incorporating nature of this class of verbs is explained by their being light verbs.},

We discuss the limitations of a standard algorithm for OT learning and outline how the GLA attempts to overcome these limitations. We point out a number of serious shortcomings with the GLA (a) A methodological problem is that the GLA has not been tested on unseen data, which is standard practice in computational language learning. (b) We provide counterexamples, that is, attested data sets that the GLA is not able to learn. (c) Essential algorithmic properties of the GLA (correctness and convergence) have not been proven formally. (d) By modeling frequency distributions in the grammar, the GLA conflates the notions of competence and performance. Thsi leads to serious conceptual problems, as OT crucially relies on the competence/performance distinction.},

This is true of the formation and interpretation of relative clauses, focus constructions, nominalizations, control structures, imperatives, the distribution of reflexives, and more. Similar claims hold to varying extents in related languages. Limiting ourselves to Malagasy, we derive, and compositionally interpret, nuclear Ss headed by verbs in different voices. Such Ss are directly projected from verbal affixes, not derived by A or A' movement, contra other approaches. We derive relative clauses (RCs) directly from predicates in different voices. No operator movement is needed or used. We compositionally interpret RCs, which only requires interpreting predicates in different voices but not variable binding operators or bound variables. This yields a new analysis of the ``Subjects Only'' constraint in Malagasy. Further, Malagasy's rich voice system suggests a cognitive trigger for the use of variable binding operators in RCs in voice-poor languages such as English.},

Both analyses have also been proposed for ET sentences in other Western Austronesian languages. For instance, in Malagasy, a Western Austronesian language spoken in Madagascar, Pearson (1996) and Paul (2000) defend a small clause analysis of ET sentences, whereas Polinsky (2008) argues persuasively for an analysis involving an unaccusative predicate. At various points in this commentary, I try to push the typology of ET further by suggesting possible typological correlates of their form.},

The analysis is crucially rests on the independently motivated single constituent structure of extended nominal phrases (see Kamio (1983), Terada (1990)). Within this analysis, various contrasts involving the scrambling of numerals, approximate numerals, and quantifiers (leaving behind their associated noun phrases), which have thus far resisted a principled explanation, are shown to be deducible from a natural interaction of two independently motivated analyses: (i) the proper Binding Condition analysis (see Saito (1989, 1992)) and (ii) the Mapping Hypothesis analysis (see Diesing (1992)).},

This article provides empirical support for this hypothesis. In Japanese loanword phonology, a voiced geminate, but not a singleton, devoices to dissimilate from another voiced obstruent within a single stem. Based on this observation, I argue that the [ voice] feature is protected by two different faithfulness constraints, IDENT( voi)Sing and IDENT( voi)Gem, and they are ranked as IDENT( voi)Sing $>>$ IDENT( voi)Gem in Japanese. I further argue that this ranking is grounded in the relative perceptibility of [ voice] in singletons and geminates, and this claim is experimentally supported. The general theoretical implication is that phonetic perceptibility can directly influence patterns in a phonological grammar.},

In Japanese loanword phonology, only voiced geminates, but not voiced singletons, devoice to dissimilate from another voiced obstruent. The neutralizability difference follows from a ranking which Japanese speakers created on perceptual grounds: IDENT(voi)Sing $>>$ IDENT(voi)Gem. On the other hand, the trigger of devoicing\textemdash{}OCP(voi)\textemdash{}has no phonetic underpin- ning because voicing does not have phonetic characteristics that would naturally lead to confusion-based dissimilation (Ohala, Proceedings of Chicago Linguistic Society: Papers from the parasession on language and behaviour, 1981, in: Jones (ed.) Historical linguistics: Problems and perspectives, 1993). OCP(voi) in Modern Japanese originated as a phonetically natural OCP(prenasal) in Old Japanese because the spread out heavy nasalization would lead to perceptual confusion, but it divorced from its phonetic origin when prenasalization became voicing. The interaction of the three constraints in Modern Japanese suggests that phonetic naturalness (the ranking IDENT(voi)Sing $>>$ IDENT(voi)Gem) and unnaturalness (OCP(voi)) co-reside within a single module.},

  volume = {16},
  abstract = {Using data from a large-scale corpus, this paper establishes the claim that in Japanese rap rhymes, the degree of similarity of two consonants positively correlates with their likelihood of making a rhyme pair. For example, similar consonant pairs like m-n, t-s, and r-n frequently rhyme whereas dissimilar consonant pairs like m-\`o, w-k, and n-p rarely do. The current study adds to a body of literature that suggests that similarity plays a fundamental role in half rhyme formation (A. Holtman, 1996, A generative theory of rhyme: An optimality approach, PhD dissertation. Utrecht Institute of Linguistics; R. Jakobson, 1960, Linguistics and poetics: Language in literature, Harvard University Press, Cambridge; D.

Zwicky, 1976, This rock-and-roll has got to stop: Junior's head is hard as a rock. Proceedings of Chicago Linguistics Society, 12, 676\textendash{}697). Furthermore, it is shown that Japanese speakers take acoustic details into account when they compose rap rhymes. This study thus supports the claim that speakers possess rich knowledge of psychoacoustic similarity (D. Steriade, 2001a, Directional asymmetries in place assimilation. In E. Hume, \& K. Johnson (Eds.), The role of speech perception in phonology (pp. 219\textendash{}250). San Diego: Academic Press.; D.

In this paper I first outline the motivation for the probabilistic turn and Lewis' triviality results, which stand in the way of what would seem to be its most straightforward implementation. I then focus on Richard Jeffrey's `random-variable' approach, which circumvents these problems by giving up the notion that conditionals denote propositions in the usual sense. Even so, however, the random-variable approach makes counterintuitive predictions in simple cases of embedded conditionals. I propose to address this problem by enriching the model with an explicit representation of causal dependencies. The addition of such causal information not only remedies the shortcomings of Jeffrey's conditional, but also opens up the possibility of a unified probabilistic account of indicative and counterfactual conditionals.},

  volume = {11},
  abstract = {The possibility of null subjects in a language has been attributed to the pronominal character of its Agreement morphology. Instead of considering a pronominal Infl as the licenser adn/or identifier of the empty pronoun pro, I will analyze the Agreement morphemes as independent D items in the numeration, containing case and phi-features. They are merged with verbs inflected for tense as their external arguments. Attracted to T by its strong D-feature, Agreement raises to T, checking its case and phi-features. As a consequence Spec of T is not projected. Lexical subjects and strong pronouns are in a higher projection, where they get a "default" nominative case. Non-pronominal Agreement languages will have weak pronouns merged with a fully inflected verb and will exhibit subject pronouns doubled by a strong pronoun, a phenomenon not visible when the subject is the Agreement itself. The empirical evidence of this analysis will be provided by diachronic facts from Old French and Modern Brazilian Portuguese, which show that the loss of null referential subjects correlates with the impoverishment of person distinctions in their Agreement system and with the emergence of a paradigm of weak pronominals. The analysis also suggests how to analyze null subjects in emerging grammars.},

  abstract = {The present paper investigates the phenomenon of "inflected complementizers" seen in many Continental West Germanic dialects. The proposal developed takes as its point of departure the commonality of linear distribution between inflected complementizers and finite verbs that exhibit the same kind of special morphology. The commonality manifests itself in implicational relationships, which strongly suggest that the behavior of complementizers is an analogical extension of morphological mergers involving finite verbs in teh same linear position. Under this analysis, the occurrence of inflectional markings on wh-phrases in embedded complementizer-less questions and relative clauses can be seen as a straightforward extension of the same mechanism. We further propose a concrete implementation of this proposal in Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar, which builds on Zwicky's distinction between morphological FORM and SHAPE. Finally, we argue that the approach based on analogical extensions of shape alternations is better suited to motivate the emergence of the phenomenon than current proposals that assume a universal agreement relationship between complementizers and subjects, regardless of whether that agreement relation is overtly manifested.},

The study addresses the issue of whether a non-parametrized principle of UG that is instantiated in the first language (L1) is "active enough" in the early stages of L2 learning to apply to phenomena for which there are no counterparts in the L1. The phenomenon investigated here involves case partcle deletion in Japanese. The nominative case and accusative case contrast in terms of their omissibility \textendash{} the latter can be freely dropped, whereas the former cannot. This contrast is regulated by the Empty Category Principle \textendash{} a principle that exists in essentially the same form in English but that applies to a very different set of phenomena in that language. Not only did the L2 learners exhibit a statistically significant difference in the deletability of the nominative and accusative cases, consistent witht he UG prinicple, their perfomance was not significanlty different from that of a native speaker control group. The results point toward the conlusion that UG is operative in second-language acquisition and that nonparametrized principles are active enough to apply to an enteirely new phenomenon.},

We identify some 10 phonological indexes that identify the loan's Japanese provenance and examine their relative rate of retention in 287 loan forms that show a mixture of Japanese-style and direct-English-style phonological characteristics. Our chief finding is that certain traits of Japanese-style loanwords are more resistant to change to the direct English style of adaptation that is applied to contemporary loans. We consider two possible explanations for such a hierarchy. First, the resistance hierarchy reflects the relative perceptual saliency of the relevant features (cf. Steriade, 2001). Second, the resistance hierarchy reflects the degree of confidence Korean speakers have about the ``correct'' direct-English borrowing pattern.},

  abstract = {This article investigates the role of syntactic and prosodic markedness constraints on the construction of phonological phrases (/- or p-phrases) in Catalan. It is shown that the construction of prosodic structure in this language cannot solely rely on syntactic information but rather also has to refer to prosodic markedness constraints which regulate the size and eurhythmicity of phrase constituents. Specifically, phonological phrasing in Catalan is determined, among other things, by the interaction of right-alignment of syntactic and phonological phrases (Align-XP,R; Selkirk 1986) and the requirement that each XP is contained in a p-phrase (Wrap-XP; Truckenbrodt 1995) together with the following set of prosodic factors: 1) a maximal requirement on the length of p-phrases at the end of utterances, Max-Bin-End, which requires that each p-phrase containing a nuclear stress should contain at most two prosodic words; 2) a minimality constraint on the prosodic parsing of utterances, Min- Utt, which requires that each utterance contains a minimally binary p-phrase; 3) a eurhythmic condition, No-Clash, which does not allow the presence of two immediately adjacent stressed syllables, partly affects phrasing decisions in this language. Size and eurhythmic effects of this type are also active, though in a weaker fashion, in other Romance languages such as Italian (Ghini 1993a, 1993b), in Brazilian Portuguese (Sandalo \& Truckenbrodt 2002), and in European Portuguese and Spanish (Elordieta et al. 2003, Prieto (forthcoming)).},

This is most relevant in accounting for the different alternations involving /nl/ and /ln/ sequences. There are certain alternations involving these sequences which occur but are not predicted under the Davis and Shin analysis. I will show that such alternations reflect the importance of word structure and can be accounted for by implementing output-to-output constraints in addition to the constraints and rankings posited by Davis and Shin.},

  abstract = {This paper aims to give an explicit categorial syntax and formal semantics of various forms of floating quantifiers (FQs) in Korean. Non-case-marked FQs are assigned the category of NP modifier, i.e., NP$\backslash$NP and this categorization, together with the combinatorial operation of functional composition, can handle the basic cases of subject/object asymmetry. An FQ in front of a transitive verb can compose with the verb, making itself related only to the object, but not to the subject. Case-marked FQs show no such asymmetry and they can be handled when they are assigned cat- egories of VP or TV modifiers. Discourse factors are also relevant for FQs particularly because FQs with discourse markers, which signify some discourse-relevant prominence, enjoy the full freedom of word order as usual adverbs. Non-case-marked FQs can also be used as adver- bials in a strong discourse context such as a ``contrastive'' one or nonconstituent coordination construction, but discourse effects are not as strong in Korean as in Japanese, as shown by still-awkward sentences with topicalized FQs. The absence of discourse restriction of contrastiveness with respect to dative NP hosts is another indication that Korean FQs are less affected by discourse factors than Japanese ones. Discourse factors are more grammaticalized in Korean than in Japanese.},

Several converging arguments are given that verbs come before their complements in the underlying structure. Apparent counterexamples come from the presence of identifiable functional heads within the verb phrase structure that attract NPs to their specifier position. Two such heads are distinguished: AgrO 0, which attracts an NP nonlocally for purposes of licensing accusative Case, and Infin0, which attracts the closest NP to check an EPP feature regardless of whether it is Case marked. We briefly compare our analysis to remnant movement analyses to sharpen the typology of leftward movement in natural language. We conclude that the success of Kayne's (1994) approach to word order depends on uncovering and cataloging the triggers of these movements.},

By way of two case studies, it is demonstrated that reference to edge domains in both the narrow syntax and at the syntax-phonology interface facilitates principled explanations to two unsolved puzzles in Nupe. The first study investigates a peculiar restriction on extraction from perfect domains. The most tenable solution emerges when both phase edges and Edge Features are embraced. New insights into the nature of Edge Features arise as a consequence. The second study concerns the proper characterization of Comp-trace effects in the language. The most tenable characterization emerges when they are viewed through the lens of the syntax-phonology interface. Comp-trace phenomena are shown to exhibit phono-syntactic edge sensitivity. New insights into the syntax-phonology interface arise as a consequence.},

  abstract = {This article investigates the syntax and semantics of a construction attested in several varieties of German, in which an indefinite determiner occurs twice (e.g., ein so ein Kerl `a such a guy'). It is argued that this phenomenon, which we refer to as indefinite determiner doubling, is restricted to structures containing a quantificational element, i.e., the elements appearing between the two determiners are quantifiers, providing additional evidence for Matthewson's (Natural Language Semantics, 9: 145\textendash{}189, 2001) analysis of quantification, according to which a generalized quantifier is created in two steps, crucially involving a DP complement. The top, or `doubling,' determiner operates on this quantificational structure, functioning as a cardinality element. The analysis is extended to indefinite determiner doubling constructions in varieties of English (e.g., a such a man) and to constructions with definite determiner doubling in (some varieties of) German. The micro-variation observed across German (and English) dialects with respect to the presence versus absence of the doubling determiner is confined to the PF-component, whose different properties across the two systems impose a preference, or a choice, for one or the other spell-out form (phonetically overt or phonetically silent). The variation observed with respect to the elements between the two determiners within and across different varieties of German is due to the (re-)analysis of these closed-class elements within different (functional) layers of DP-structure.},

  volume = {40},
  abstract = {This article argues that natural languages have two binding strategies that create two types of bound variable pronouns. Pronouns of the first type, which include local fake indexicals, reflexives, relative pronouns, and PRO, may be born with a ``defective'' feature set. They can acquire the features they are missing (if any) from verbal functional heads carrying standard -operators that bind them. Pronouns of the second type, which include long-distance fake indexicals, are born fully specified and receive their interpretations via context-shifting -operators (Cable 2005). Both binding strategies are freely available and not subject to syntactic constraints. Local anaphora emerges under the assumption that feature transmission and morphophonological spell-out are limited to small windows of operation, possibly the phases of Chomsky 2001. If pronouns can be born underspecified, we need an account of what the possible initial features of a pronoun can be and how it acquires the features it may be missing. The article develops such an account by deriving a space of possible paradigms for referential and bound variable pronouns from the semantics of pronominal features. The result is a theory of pronouns that predicts the typology and individual characteristics of both referential and bound variable pronouns.},

I will provide an analysis of the pattern within Optimality Theory and show that derived environment effects can be accounted for by recourse to the featural level in the interpretation of alignment constraints and by the use of a lesser studied faithfulness constraint, i.e., the contiguity constraint.

Properties of words follow from regular syntactic principles and phonological properties of affixes. Agreement can be triggered under piedpiping.

It treats the phenomenon as reflexivization (Chierchia 2004), providing a number of new arguments for this kind of treatment, and showing how it, as opposed to alternatives in the literature, accounts for the wide range of data reviewed. In addition, the facts laid out show that inchoatives derived from causatives retain the CAUSE operator present in the lexical semantic representation of the causative verb from which they are derived, contrary to the widely held view of anticausativization as a process that deletes a CAUSE operator. In this way, it is shown that anticausativization does not provide an argument against the Monotonicity Hypothesis, the idea that word formation operations do not delete operators from lexical semantic representations.},

  abstract = {This study looks at the acquisition of obligatory overt arguments in L2 English by adult L1 Chinese speakers and sets out to explain the divergence between non-native speakers and native speakers in relation parameter-resetting in SLA within the framework of Principles and Parameters. In particular, we test a proposal made by Yuan [1997, Studies in Second Language Acquisition 2, 16\textendash{}32] which argues for initial full transfer of the Chinese functional category features into L2 English. Chinese speakers then readjust the features of Infl as a result of contact with English, and this requires their grammars to have obligatory subjects. However, they continue to allow null objects in their English simply because positive evidence is not available to eliminate them. The implication of Yuan's proposal is that features of functional categories in the L2 which differ from those in the L1 are in principle resettable, which argues against the claim made by Tsimpli and Roussou [1991, UCL Workings Papers in Linquistics 3, 149\textendash{}170], and Smith and Tsimpli [1995, The Mind of Savant: Language Learning and Modulority, Blackwell, Oxford.] that parameter values associated with functional categories are inaccessible to L2 learners after the critical period. The results do not lend support to Yuan's claim that the recognition of the features of Infl in English causes Chinese speakers to unlearn null subjects while lack of positive evidence in relation to functional category features allows them to continue accepting null objects. Rather, they support the view of Tsimpli and Roussou and Smith and Tsimpli that older learners do not reset their parameters. It could be argued that learners are more successful in disallowing null matrix subjects than null arguments in other positions because they make a small adjustment to the use of topic chains while the parameter settings of Chinese are maintained. This adjustment is that one topic at the head of every sentence must be overt.},

I proposed that de-phrase asymmetries (in the domain of extraction and in other domains) correlate with an independently motivated semantic partition \textendash{} one between individual-denoting phrases (IDPs) that pick out an entity in discourse, and property-denoting phrases (PDPs) that determine a type of entity. I put forward the Nominal Denotation Hypothesis (NDH): at moset one de-phrase of each type can be associated with a given noun (n) head. I subsequently demonstrate (a) that a number of problematic exceptions to the thematic hierarchy can be directly accounted for under NDH, (b) that further facets of de-phrase behaviour bearing on matters of general distribution, aspect, linear order, definiteness/specificity, and the potential/lack of potential for exhibiting scopal ambiguity (which were not accounted for in previous works relying ont he thematic hierarchy) also originate in NDH, and (c) that NDH is nonetheless compatible with certian fundamental aspects of previous approaches (in both derivational and lexicalist frameworks).},

The syntax of aspect in Thai suggests that syntactic and semantic structures are independent levels of representation that are not mapped uniformly onto each other and that a functional category's lexical entry must record both its part of speech and its combinatorial potential.},

  abstract = {This paper discusses Japanese numeral quantifiers that are used to count individuals, rather than quantities of a substance, and which may occur either as floated or non-floated quantifiers. It is argued that such morphologically complex numeral quantifiers (NQs) are semantically complex as well: The numeral within the NQ is the quantifier itself, the classifier its domain of quantification. The proposed analysis offers a unified semantic account of floated and non-floated NQs that adheres closely to their surface morphology and syntax. It explains why floated NQs generally force a distributive reading. It covers both classifiers construed with objects and classifiers construed with events. In addition, it captures the fact that the classifier must agree with the NP it is construed with.},

Building upon the proposal in Wexler 2003 that young English-acquiring children overuse the with presuppositional indefinites, this article proposes that presuppositionality also influ- ences article (mis)use in adult L2 acquisition. This proposal is supported by experimental results from the L2 English of adult speakers of Korean, a language with no articles. The experimental findings indicate that presuppositional indefinite contexts trigger overuse of the with indefinites in adult L2 acquisition, as in child L1 acquisition (cf. Wexler 2003). The effects of presuppositionality are teased apart from the effects of other semantic factors previously examined in acquisition, such as scope (Schaeffer and Matthewson 2005) and specificity (Ionin, Ko, and Wexler 2004). The results provide evidence that over- use of the in L2 acquisition is a semantic rather than pragmatic phenomenon. Implications of these findings for overuse of the in L1 acquisition are discussed. This article also has implications for the study of access to Universal Grammar in L2 acquisition, as well as for the number and type of semantic universals underlying article choice crosslinguistically.},

  volume = {23},
  abstract = {This paper proposes that `why' in wh-in-situ languages (Korean, Japanese, and Chinese) is directly merged into [Spec,CP] of the clause it modifies. This proposal not only captures long-standing issues regarding the peculiarity of `why', as opposed to other wh-phrases, but also accounts for previously unnoticed asymmetries among why-constructions. In particular, I argue that due to its initial merge position, `why' in an interrogative clause is licensed with external merge while `why' in a declarative clause must undergo LF-movement. This argument is supported by the non-uniform behavior of `why' with respect to the Intervention Effect in Korean and Japanese (cf. Beck and Kim 1997) and is further confirmed by the question-marker drop phenomenon in Japanese. Under this proposal, a puzzling divergence between Chinese and Korean/Japanese in why-constructions is reduced to the fact that Chinese disallows Abar-scrambling. The proposal also captures a syntactic parallelism between `why' in wh-in-situ languages and `why' in wh-fronting languages, like Italian and Irish. Among the theoretical consequences of this paper is a demonstration that a subject may scramble (cf. Saito 1985) and that string-vacuous scrambling is responsible for judgment variations concerning the Intervention Effect.},

In particular, I investigate a range of vowel hiatus resolution phenomena that differ between nouns and verbs, the overapplication of consonant cluster simplification and laryngeal feature neutralization in nominal stems, and certain asymmetries between derived nouns and nonderived nouns. After presenting some problems with previous approaches, I offer an analysis of the phonology of Korean nominal inflection in terms of BASE-OUTPUT CORRESPONDENCE (BOC) THEORY, along the lines of Kager (1999). I argue that a variety of unexpected properties of noun phonology in Korean can receive a unified account under the BOC approach. I also show that noun-specific alignment and noun-specific faithfulness constraints are inadequate to capture noun phonology in Korean. My arguments support the view that the fact that nouns have a Base (isolation form) is the key factor in explaining the unique properties of noun phonology (see Kenstowicz's (1996) BASE IDENTITY, in particular). It is shown, however, that the BOC approach overcomes shortcomings with the Base Identity approach by making a necessary distinction between minor and fatal divergence from the Base.},

The findings indicate that the more frequent use of both the passive and the by-phrase in Sesotho child-directed speech, in conjunction with the non-ambiguous passive morpheme, may together facilitate earlier access to thematic roles (agent, patient), thereby promoting early implicit learning of the passive.

We argue that all these characterisations are intuitively plausible, but none of them is precise. We propose that these particles serve to mark which part of a sentence's descriptive content is asserted, and that their aspectual value is a consequence of this function. We provide a simple and precise definition of the menaings of le, guo, zai and zhe in terms of the relationship between topic time and time of situation, and show the consequences of their interaction with different verb expressions within this new framework of interpretation.},

The aim of this paper is to show that apparent counterexamples, in fact, provide new evidence in favor of B\"uring and Hartmann's Particle Theory.

The single argument of Kambera intransitives can be marked by five different pronominal clitic combinations, each of the constructions expressing a differenct contextual property. One of the constructions is the absolutive construction, in which an intransitive subject is either obligatorily or optionally treated like a transitive object ('fluid-S marking', Dixon 1979, 1994). An analysis of the possible origin, structure and contextual propoerties of Kambera fluid-S marking will be given and it will be proposed that in general the morphosyntactic expression of intransitive arguments is not lexically determined nor based on syntactic information coded in the lexical entry but rather depends on teh context in which the verb is used. The Kambera facts will be related to the qauestion of which information the lexical entry of an intransitive is universally supposed to contain, in particular, whether or not that information should be syntactically relevant.},

Instead, I assume that the same syntactic and semantic constraints interact to determine the grammaticality of both extraposed and non-extraposed relative clauses. Syntactically, the proposed constraints lead to the configurational superiority of the relative clause. This superiority has its origin in the semantics of the relative clause: the relative pronoun is referentially defective and remedies this deficiency by selecting an appropriate antecedent.

The proposal is based on the following assumptions: The derivatin of the Hungarian sentence involves a lexical phase (PredP) and a functional phase (a TP or a FocP), both headed by the raised V. When the functional phase is constructed, the silent lower copies ofhte V and their projections are deleted, which results in the flattening of the phasal domain. Grammatical phenomena indicative of a hierarchical structure are interpreted on the hierarchical domain of the lexical phase, whereas those indicative of a flat sturcture are interpreted on the flattened domain of the functional phase. The sister constituents of the flattened domain of the functional phase can be linearized in a free order in PF.},

LF movement employed for Case checking is argued to involve the raising of a phrasal category, on the basis that it displays properties different from those of nonphrasal movement in LF. The newly attested data from Japanese lead to the conclusion that constituents can be reordered after "narrow" syntax and that strict locality is required for checking to take place, contrary to Chomsky's (2000, 20001) proposal.},

In the light of nominalized clauses in which dative-V and accusative-V idioms are embedded, this article shows that ditransitive verbs project an argument structure whereby dative arguments could be base-generated to either the left or the right of accusative arguments, as countenanced by the base-generation hypothesis for the argument order of ditransitive verbs. Nevertheless, dative arguments are not freely ordered relative to accusative arguments. We argue that with ordinary ditransitive verbs, only the dative-accusative order is available by base-generation, the reverse order being derived via syntactic movement, as conceived by the movement hypothesis. We suggest that the dative position below an accusative argument does not reside in a h-marking domain, and thus it can be filled only by idiomatic dative arguments that are interpreted without h-role assignment. The data show that both base-generation and movement analyses are necessary for characterizing the word order variation of Japanese ditransitive verbs.},

We apply a set of diagnostics drawn from the Romance literature and find that, for this particular feature, the Newfoundland variety patterns like Standard French and not like the other varieties of Canadian French, that is, subject clitics behave like syntactic subjects. We argue that historical developments related to number marking have resulted in crossdialectal variation in French subject clitic systems. This conclusion is supported by the quantitative analysis of subject clitic use in present-day French dialects.},

This evidence is important because it shows that hte set of operators that enter into chain composition must all be homogeneous in terms of operator structures and operator types, and that, crucially, this homogeneity condition on compound chains must hold at LF.

This article thus argues that null NPs in these languages must be empty phrase-markers underlyingly, not empty pronouns per se, and hence, their reference properties can be determined only at LF after reconstruction.

The contrast between tense and lax stops raises two theoretical problems. First, to distinguish them either a new feature [tense] is needed, or the contrast in voicing (or aspiration) must be increased from two to three. Either way there is a large increase in the number of possible stops in the world's languages, but the expansion lacks support beyond Korean. Second, initial aspirated and tense consonants correlate with a high tone, and lax and voiced consonants correlate with a low tone. The correlation cannot be explained in the standard tonogenesis model (voiceless-high and voiced-low). We argue instead that (a) underlyingly "tense" stops are regular voiceless unaspirated stops, and "lax" stops are regular voiced stops, (b) there is no compelling evidence for a new distinctive feature, and (c) the consonant-tone correlation is another case of voiceless-high and voiced-low. We conclude that Korean does not have an unusual phonology, and there is no need to complicate feature theory.},

(1995). Structural and interpretive aspects of head-internal and head-external relative clauses. PhD dissertation, University of Rochester; Shimoyama, J. (2001). Wh-constructions in Japanese. PhD dissertation, University of Massachusetts at Amherst). In the literature, this problem refers to the difficulty of capturing the delimited semantic variability of the E-type pronoun present in the embedding clause of the construction. I show that the E-type pronoun at issue is subject to a different licensing condition from a typical E-type pronoun and therefore presents a different linking problem. More specifically, it requires that the embedded clause describe a state of its antecedent and its descriptive content be supplied by a salient property rep- resented in the logical form of the embedded clause. I propose an event-based semantic analysis that derives the effects of this novel generalization by establishing a binding relation between the event structure of the embedded clause and the denotation of the E-type pronoun.},

I solve this puzzle by recasting Kim's (2007) analysis of Internally-Headed relatives in a Kratzerian situation semantic framework (e.g., Kratzer 1989, 1998, 2002). The central claim is that the three kes-constructions have an identical form because they all instantiate situation subordination that is facilitated by an E-type pronoun and a relativization strategy. The proposed analysis shows that E-type pronouns and relativizers can have more flexible semantics than widely assumed. It also sheds new light on the connection between modification and complementation across languages. Furthermore, it provides an argument for Kratzerian situation semantic theory in dealing with the interpretations of complex clauses.},

The experiment tested the long-distance and local interpretations of different Korean anaphors\textemdash{}caki, casin, and caki-casin\textemdash{}by 51 Korean-English bilinguals raised in Korean-speaking families residing in the United States (22 early bilinguals and 29 late bilinguals) together with a control group of 34 Korean monolinguals residing in Korea. Overall results indicated that the bilinguals maintain the distinction between local and long-distance anaphors, though not to the same degree as monolinguals. There was a tendency among early bilinguals to choose more local binding overall compared to the late bilinguals and Korean monolinguals. At the individual level, many early bilinguals failed to differentiate between caki-casin and casin in terms of binding distance, treating both as local anaphors, whereas monolinguals and late bilinguals tended to collapse caki and casin, treating both as long distance anaphors},

  title = {Korean {{Honorification}}: {{A Kind}} of {{Expressive Meaning}}},
  volume = {16},
  abstract = {Honorification in Korean recognizes the elevated social status of a participant in a clause with respect to the subject and/or the hearer. Honorific marking may be manifest as a nominal suffix, a special honorific form of a noun, an honorific case particle, an honorific marker on a verb, or a special honorific form of a verb. Previous accounts have typically proposed a honorification feature specified as [HON +], with unmarked forms being [HON )]. The key idea in this paper is that these approaches are misguided and that honorification is a privative feature, syntactically and semantically. On the syntactic side, we argue that the frequently adopted position that honorific marking in Korean is a kind of subject\textendash{}verb agreement is deeply misguided. Few previous accounts succeed with regard to the full range of facts, which are of three types. First, multiple expressions of honorific marking within the same clause progressively elevate the social status of the referent: the effect is cumulative, which [HON \$$\backslash$pm\$] cannot describe. Second, under previous analyses, some nouns have to be given a spurious and ultimately inconsistent ambiguity with respect to their honorific properties. Third, the different expressions of ``honorification'' do not mean exactly the same thing, which makes an account of multiple honorification within a clause in terms of agreement implausible. On the semantic side, we, building on ideas in Potts (The logic of conventional implicatures. Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2005) and Potts and Kawahara (Proceedings of semantics and linguistic theory. CLC Publications, Ithaca, NY, pp. 235\textendash{}254, 2004), propose that honorific forms introduce a dimension of meaning in the realm of expressive meaning. As a kind of expressive meaning, honorification is simply absent from all forms which are not positively marked for expressing it.},

Lexical idiosyncracy motivates treating finite negation as a verbal complement, while constituent negation is treated in terms of a familiar modifier-head construction. General priniciples ordering lexical and phrasal heads ensure that negation (the adverbs not and pas) follows the finite verb (the finite auxiliary verb in English), while only constituent negation appears preverbally. Our constraint-based account, cast within the framework of Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar, provides a viable alternative (with broader coverage, fewer devices and simpler principles) to analyses based on head movement, which seek to explain the syntax of negation and adverbial positions in terms ofhte interaction of morphological properties, verb movement, and functional projections.},

In order to verify the place of articulation of Korean affricates, I reconsider some previous phonological accounts of their place of articulation and argue that Korean affricates are neither palato-alveolar nor alveolopalatal. By reveiweing phonetic studies of Kroean consonants (e.r., Skalickova, 1960; Kim., 1997, 1998a, 1998b, 1999) and other languges' coronal consonants, I show that the plain affricate /c/ is alveolar like the other coronal consonants in Korean, not post-alveolar, in support of my phonological arguments.},

Both of these properties follow from the postulation of a rich base, with features freely combining in inputs.

  title = {Binding {{Principles}} and {{ACD Constructions}} in {{Child Grammars}}},
  volume = {7},
  abstract = {Antecedent-contained deletion (ACD) constructions have been the focus of much recent literature in linguistic theory. These constructions have been instrumental in arguments against dispensing with the operation of Quantifier Raising (QR) and a level of Logical Form (LF) (e.g., May 1985; Fiengo \& May 1994; Fox 1999, 2000). In fact, it has been argued that in ACD constructions, the binding principles apply at LF (e.g., Fiengo \& May 1994). The present paper assesses 4- and 5-year old children's knowledge of ACD constructions in which principles B and C are relevant. The empirical findings show that children interpret these ACD structures like adults, suggesting that they invoke the binding principles at LF, andtarge vP, rather than IP as the landing site for QR, as claimed for adults by Fox (2000) and others. These central properties of ACD construcitons in child grammars present a challenge to learning-based theories of language development, because the input to children cannot inform them how to interpret the ellipsis site of ACD structures or which binding principle is in effect. Nevertheless, preschool children are found to have adultlike interpretations of the structures investigated here. the data are taken to provide support for hte view that binding principles are part of our innate human endowment for language.},

  volume = {82},
  abstract = {A model of speech production is proposed in which the input is a planning stage at which lexical items are arrayed, accompanied by the full panoply of phonological representations from distinctive features to their attendant tree structures. A set of instructions for control of the vocal tract is calculated leading to a sound output. Two parallel processes are involved in the calculation of these instructions, both of which replace the planning-stage representation by the appropriate motoric instructions. One of these processes is universal and involves replacing each distinctive feature with an appropriate set of motoric instructions, either unmodified or modified by the process of overlap. We postulate a parallel language-specific process that is sensitive to those features in danger of losing their perceptual saliency as a consequence of the environment in which they appear. This process, referred to as ENHANCEMENT, adds additional motoric instructions to enhance the saliency of the jeopardized features. We provide a number of examples to illustrate how enhancement works. We conclude from these examples that whereas defining gestures related to distinctive features are, in many instances, weakened or even absented from the speech stream, enhancement gestures, once added to the set of motoric instructions, appear never to be subject to obliteration by overlap.},

The premise of MPA is that reduplicative morphemes can be stem-internal or stem-external and that this distinction is visible to the phonological component through general constraints on the association of stem-internal and stem-external morphemes to prosodic categories. I illustrate the model with Moronene, Klamath, and Gooniyandi, each of which has several reduplicative morphemes. MPA meets the challenge for an optimality-theoretic model to account for such systems without resorting to morpheme-specific indexed constraints or cophonological constraint hierarchies.},

This paper investigates a complex array of facts in this domain that shows that attributive comparatives, unlike other comparatives, are well-formed only if some type of ellipsisoperation applies within the comparative clause. Incorporating data from English, Polish, Czech, Greek, and Bulgarian, we argue that these facts support two important conclusions. First, violations of Ross's Left Branch Condition that involve attributive modifiers should not be accounted for in terms of constraints on LF representations (such as the Empty Category Principle), but rather in terms of the principle of Full Interpretation at the PF interface. Second, ellipsis must be analyzed as deletion of syntactic material from the phonologica representaiton. In addition, we present new evidence from pseudogapping constructions that favors an articulated syntax of attributive modificaiton in which certain types of attributive modifiers may occur outside DP.},

Although this derivational difference must be stipulated in standard approaches, it follows from general constraints on the relation between movement and deletion in English in a model of syntax in which syntactic constratins are ranked and violable, and well-formedness is determined by evaluating competing representations against the set of constraints, as in Optimality Theory. The analysis receives independent support from the interaction of comparatives and ellipsis, and achieves a higher level of descriptive and explanatory adequacy than alternative analyses that do not make reference to ranked violable constraints.},

Without an intervening Classifier, it can be realized in N. This analysis captures the fact that the -men type plural morpheme is generally found in classifier languages and the English type plural morpheme in non-classifier languages. The plural analysis of -men also captures many generalizations missing from the traditional "collective" analysis, such as (i) -men can occur with a proper name/pronoun/definite common noun but not a definite expression of the form [Demonstrative + Classifier +N], (ii) a quantity expression [Number + Classifier] can follow a pronoun/proper name with -men but not a common noun with -men, and (iii) a quantify expression cannot precede a nominal with -men.},

  volume = {79},
  abstract = {Most approaches to spatial language have assumed that the simplest spatial notions are (after Piaget) topological and universal (containment, contiguity, proximity, support, represented as semantic primitives such as IN, ON, UNDER, etc.). These concepts would be coded directly in language, above all in small closed classes such as adpositions\textemdash{}thus providing a striking example of semantic categories as language-specific projections of universal conceptual notions. This idea, if correct, should have as a consequence that the semantic categories instantiated in spatial adpositions should be essentially uniform crosslinguistically. This article attempts to verify this possibility by comparing the semantics of spatial adpositions in nine unrelated languages, with the help of a standard elicitation procedure, thus producing a preliminary semantic typology of spatial adpositional systems. The differences between the languages turn out to be so significant as to be incompatible with stronger versions of the UNIVERSAL CONCEPTUAL CATEGORIES hypothesis. Rather, the language-specific spatial adposition meanings seem to emerge as compact subsets of an underlying semantic space, with certain areas being statistical ATTRACTORS or FOCI. Moreover, a comparison of systems with different degrees of complexity suggests the possibility of positing implicational hierarchies for spatial adpositions. But such hierarchies need to be treated as successive divisions of semantic space, as in recent treatments of basic color terms. This type of analysis appears to be a promising approach for future work in semantic typology.},

  volume = {28},
  abstract = {This paper addresses the compositionality puzzle presented by a class of `pseudo-resultative' predicates, such as tight in the sentence She braided her hair tight. The analysis proposed reveals that the modification involved also provides insight into the nature of the lexical roots of verbs and their role in compositional semantics. Pseudo-resultative predicates superficially resemble resultative secondary predicates and resultative adverbs. However, it is shown that they do not modify any `word' in the syntax. Rather, these predicates modify the root of the verb in a configuration which is licensed by the semantic type of the root and the structure of root creation verbs. The modification of such roots provides evidence that they are syntactically active, as proposed in the framework of Distributed Morphology (Halle and Marantz 1993; Marantz 1997; Arad 2003). It is shown that the roots are syntactically well-behaved and can be modified just like other `larger' constituents. Syntactic parallels between the root creation verbs which license pseudo-resultative predicates and other structures further provide evidence for a syntactic decomposition of these verbs whereby the object is related to the root in a prepositional structure in a manner reminiscent of proposals for other classes of verbs in Hale and Keyser (1993, 2002).},

For is analyzed as a prepositional complementizer whose complement contains the (silent) nominal and the trace of what, to which for assigns accusative Case. The projection of for, forP, is argued to sit in a specifier position in the extended projection of the head noun, similar to adjectival modifiers on a Cinquean view.

The RDDR/optional movement account predicts that G-SLI subjects would have deficits with both WH-operator and Q-feature movement and therefore would have particular problems producing object questions. We elicited 36 questions balanced for subject and object questions and WH-words (who, which, what). The G-SLI subjects were significantly impaired in producing WH-questions, showing particular difficulties with object questions in relation to the control children. The majority of G-SLI subjects (80\%) evinced both WH-operator and T/Q-feature movement errors whereas only one control child (4\%) did so, yet on occasion all the G-SLI subjects used appropriate movement operations to satisfy the WH-criterion. We conclude that the RDDR account whereby movement is optional is consistent with the findings of correct and incorrect WH-question formation. Thus, this first test of the RDDR account of G-SLI is supported by the findings. We discuss the possible underlying nature of a grammar that could cause such optionality, the implications for normal and impaired language acquisition, and the generalizability of the findings to other groups of children with SLI. We propose that in the face of no movement, the WH-word and, on occasion, do are merged in situ in the CP, and function as an interrogative adjunct.},

It is argued, based on an analysis of French depitive and resultative secondary predicates, that secondary predicates are functional projections of the category Gender, they form constituents of their own, and they contain a PRO subject coindexed with a main subject or object. Configurationally, they are of two types: subject-oriented secondary predicates, which are adjoined to VP, and object-oriented secondary predicates, which are adjoined to VP (if resultative) or are sisters of V' (if depictive). Compared with previous analyses of secondary prediateion, the present one corroborates early proposals about the constituency and internal make-up of secondary predicates (Stowell 1981, 1983; Chomsky 1981). The main difference lies in the nature of the constituent itself: it is argued ehre that it is a functional projection, namely GernderP, an proposal which owes much to late 1980s and early 1990s explorations in the nature of syntactic categories. In particular, the present analysis leads to the proposal that Agrs and Agro (Chomsky 1991) should, at least in languages like French, be identified as Person and Gender, respectively. THe lack of productive resultative constructions in French is also addressed.},

  abstract = {The German POSSESSOR DATIVE CONSTRUCTION (PDC) is an instance of EXTERNAL POSSESSION: a single nominal acts simultaneously as possessor, that is, a subpart of a larger nominal phrase, and as a BENEFACTIVE or MALEFACTIVE (AFFECTEE) argument of the verb. The challenge is to understand the mechanisms that make this dual functioning possible. Following Landau [Lingua 107 (1999) 1], this paper presents a POSSESSOR RAISING analysis, arguing that the POSSESSOR DATIVE (PD) moves from the specifier of the possessed nominal to a verbal argument position. The analysis is implemented in a dynamic structure-building framework, where heads with their selectional features are introduced in the course of the derivation, and it is in principle possible that an argument that gets merged into the structure to take on one thematic role raises into a newly built sentence domain to fulfill another thematic role. This movement and the resulting double h-role assignment are crucially driven by formal features; that is, both stem from the fact that, in its origin site, the raised argument is not case-licensed. An additional caselicensing head is needed for the derivation to converge. This head is an affectee light verb which assigns inherent dative case to the argument in its specifier. Thus, unlike Landau's account of PDCs in Hebrew, where PDs can be interpreted as affected without actually being h-related to the verb, the analysis here offers an explanation for the crosslinguistically more general case of the PDC, where the PD's role as both possessor and affectee needs to be syntactically encoded.},

The focus is mainly on binding and how to account for instances of noncomplementarity, but also on the PDC, which can be analyzed as possessor raising.

  volume = {15},
  abstract = {It is well-known that hierarchies of person, animacy, and definiteness have effects on case marking systems in various languages, where certain classes of subjects and objects are marked, but not others. This paper presents evidence of frequency effects of those hierarchies on case ellipsis in Korean. The two major aims of this paper are the following. First of all, the significance of variable case ellipsis patterns of Korean, as found in the CallFriend Korean corpus (LDC (1996)), will be demonstrated when looked at from a functional-typological perspective: variation in case marking between style levels within a single language reflects variation across languages. In a second step, the findings from a comparative study of Korean and other languages are integrated into a coherent theoretical framework \textendash{} stochastic Optimality Theory (OT) (Boersma (1998), Boersma and Hayes (2001)). It is shown that quantitative patterning found in Korean case ellipsis can be analyzed within the stochastic OT framework in a way analogous to an account of categorical differential case marking effects proposed by Aissen (2003). In this analysis, categorical differential case marking found in various languages is viewed as conventionalization of the same universal pragmatic tendency to mark disharmonic elements, which is also present in the variable case-marking systems of languages like Japanese and Korean.},

The simple past in English and the Korean -ess at least have the potential to give dynamic information, updating the given context with a new event and shifting the current temporal perspective. The English past perfect and the Korean -essess, on the other hand, provide stative, background information, preserving the given context. However, while the English past perfect is ambiguous between preterit and aspectual interpretations, Korean -essess has only the preterit interpretation, triggering a flashback effect in narratives. Their semantic properties and differences are represented in Discourse Representation Theory.},

Contrary to this common assumption, this paper argues that "a noh" is a dynamic event description, focusing on culmination, whereas "a twu" is static, triggering a presupposition about the causal event. This opposition corresponds to a difference between asserting the completion of an event and asserting a current state resulting from a past event that is presupposed to have already taken place. This paper provides empirical evidence supporting this claim: the two markers are distinguished when embedded in change of state predicates in sentences. In discourse, "a noh" describes a following/preceding episode, whereas "a twu" expresses an overlapping state. The semantic differences between the two have been represented formally using the logical tools of Discourse Representation Theory (Kamp and Reyle (1993)). In DRT, "a noh" moves the reference time (Rpt) forward, while "a twu" represents a state preserving the give Rpt.},

I argue that the two contrasting views of aspectual adverbs as logical duals (L\"obner 1989, 1999) and as scalar (focus) particles (Michaelis 1993, 1996; Israel 1995) are both necessary in order to explain the English and Korean data. Aspect concerns the internal structure of events, relating a current state with the onset or the end of the state. These transitions are available for focusing, which triggers an explicit contrast between the asserted state and an alternative state with an opposite polarity. Korean is shown to lexicalize aspectual and focus adverbs differently from what is expressed in English by a single adverb with focus marked prosody. The meaning of aspectual and focus adverbs in both English and Korean is representated in Discourse Representation Theory (Kamp and Reyle 1993; van Eijck and Kamp 1997).},

It is argued that the difference in argument structure is determined by semantic event structure depending on agentivity in Korean.

In addition to providing substantial independent evidence for Cinque's (1999) richly-articulated clause structure and strictly ordered sequence of adverb positions, the proposed analysis of the southern Italian dialect data is demonstrated to shed light on the nature of pronominal cliticization and verb movement in Romance more generally. In particular, cliticization and verb movement are argued to variously target one of two positions in Romance, one associated with a clause-medial functional projection and the other associated with a relatively low functional projection, giving rise to four possible language types in accordance with attested Romance parametric variation.},

Semantic Reconstruction will be demonstrated to be an independently needed strategy of grammar, that is not parasitic on syntactic reconstruction as expressed by Copy Theory (Chomsky 1992). The basic difference between Semantic Reconstruction and syntactic reconstruction will be traced back to their asymmetric availability in scrambling chains: scrambling can be undone only by Semantic Reconstruction.},

  abstract = {In this paper, I defend two hypotheses as to the derivation of phonologically reduced comparative constructions. On the one hand, I present evidence which supports an ellipsis analysis of phrasal comparatives over base-generation approaches. On the other hand, it is argued that the restrictions on deletion in comparatives are exhaustively determined by the principles governing Gapping, Right Node Raising and Across-the-Board movement in coordinate structures. It follows that construction specific reduction operations such as Comparative Ellipsis can be dispensed with. Evidence for these two hypotheses comes from generalizations about the surface shape of the comparative complement and its positional distribution inside the matrix clause. As for the reason why comparatives, which manifest instances of semantic subordination, can be targeted by processes widely held to be restricted to coordinate structures, it is proposed that optional extraposition of the comparative complement establishes a derived comparative coordination, which emulates the syntax of base-generated conjunctions. The results of this study furthermore indicate that (i) comparatives need to satisfy a hitherto unidentified condition which limits possible relations between the head of an empty operator movement construction and the operator, and that (ii) the Coordinate Structure Constraint has to be formulated as a genuinely syntactic restriction.},

  volume = {19},
  abstract = {Previous analyses of control in Super-Equi have failed to account for the entire paradigm of relevant cases. A new generalization is stated: Obligatory Control (OC) obtains in extraposition only under psychological predicates. It is argued that extraposition is driven by the requirement that VP-internal clauses be peripheral at PF. This is satisfied by a Causer infinitive which is projected below an Experiencer DP, but not by one projected above a theme/goal DP. Thus extraposition is blocked in the former case and licensed in the latter. Crucially, only when the infinitive is extraposed to an adjunct position (or intraposed to a subject position) can it give rise to Non-Obligatory Control (NOC); this is supported by a correlation between NOC and failure of extraction from the infinitive. It is claimed that in OC an Agree relation is establisehd between the matrix funcitonal head that licenses the controller and an anaphoric infinitival Agr, which raises to the embedded C as a 'free-rider' on T. Since Agree is sensitive to islands, the distributional distinction between OC and NOC reduces to the CED. Failing syntactic identification, the infinitival Agr is licensed as a logophro, explaining some well-known properties of NOC in Super-Equi. The proposed account unifies a wide range of phenomena unrelated under altnerative analyses of control and Super-Equi.},

However, the two types of subjects may alternate in certain environmnets, an inexplicable fact for most existing accounts.

Traditionally, Case has been identified as the key to this problem: PRO was argued to bear no Case at all, or some special ( null ) Case. I argue that PRO bears standard case like normal lexical DPs; clear evidence comes from languages with case-concord (Russian, Hungarian, Icelandic). Moreover, PRO (and obligatory control) may occur in finite clauses (Hebrew, Balkan languages). Conclusion: PRO's distribution must be completely divorced from Case, possibly because abstract Case does not exist. The alternative is to tie the distribution of PRO to the specific values of [T] and [Agr] on the I0 and C0 heads of the embedded clause (Landau 2004). A feature-based algorithm predicts the distribution of PRO in a variety of clausal complements.

Late adjunction, in turn, cannot apply too deeply, which explains why the same set of environments inaccessible to partial VP-fronting force adjunct reconstruction.

Like all selectional requirements, it applies to the head of the selected phrase, explaining why null heads cannot appear in EPP positions (thus deriving certain representational ECP effects). A wide range of empirical results follow, all unified by the exclusion of null-headed phrases from EPP positions: subject-object asymmetries in the distribution of bare nouns in Romance and sentential complements; failure of certain adjuncts to occur in clause-initial position; resistance of indirect objects to A' -movement; and phonological doubling of heads of fronted categories. I argue against the agreement/checking view of the EPP and show that only the selectional construal allows a natural explanation of its puzzling properties.},

  abstract = {The unpronounced subject of infinitives, PRO, bears standard case, which is reflected on agreeing predicative elements in languages like Russian, Icelandic, Ancient Greek, etc. This case can be independent from the case of the controller DP, or identical to it (`case transmission'). We report the findings of a novel study of case transmission in Russian, based on data collected from 30 speakers. The findings contradict some key generalizations that have gone unchallenged in the field for decades; specifically, case transmission is much more prevalent than previously assumed, often co-occurring with the option of independent case. The pattern of case transmission is determined by the interaction of a complex set of factors\textemdash{}the grammatical function of the controller, the shape of the complementizer, the type of control relation (exhaustive or partial), and more. The proposed analysis builds on ``The Agreement Model of Obligatory Control (OC)'' (Landau 2000, 2004, 2006) and strongly supports the claim that OC exploits two routes\textemdash{}either a direct Agree relation with PRO, or one mediated by the infinitival C. It is derivationally local and free of the ``look-ahead'' properties inherent to earlier accounts. Finally, we provide a description of the documented crosslinguistic variation in this domain, and situate it within a tight typological model.},

Weak pronouns share properties of both Romance-like clitics (adjacency, clustering effects) and full pronouns (non-reduced, free-standing forms). Weak pronouns are analyzed as maximal projections prior to Spellout and as clitics, Xo elements, at LF. In overt syntax, they move as XPs to their Case-checkng position. They move beyond the Case position if that position is not close enough to their LF-host. At LF they move as Xos, i.e. they cliticize and incorporate to a V-related host. In Hebrew, the clitic host is hte participle (AgrParticipleo) in complex tenses and the verb in Agrso or in Co (inversion) in simplex tenses. In German, the pronouns' LF-host is unique: AgrSo raised to Co. Weak pronouns can form clusters, which are derived by multiple adjunction of the pronouns. Weak pronouns are also subject to an adjacency constraint, as a consequence of the Head Movement Constraint, operative on LF Incorporation.},

I argue that both prosodic principles and narrow-syntactic principles play a role in the linearization of syntactic structures. I take Kayne's (1994) Linear Correspondence Axiom as a starting point: (asymmetric) c-command maps onto precedence relations. Two wide-ranging predictions of Kayne's theory are that specifiers precede their heads and that a head can only have one specifier or adjunct. Although abundant evidence supports these predictions, there is nonetheless a well-known class of apparent counterexamples: Romance languages allow both rightward and multiple dislocations. I take the LCA to be a soft constraint, overruled by a constraint of the WRAP family that seeks to combine a verb and its extended projection in one intonational phrase. Apparent rightward movement is the outcome of rightward linearization forced by WRAP. The possibility of multiple dislocations is compatible with the LCA within the assumptions made here.},

Taking Aissen's theory of DM (Aissen 2003) as a starting point, we show that althought its predictions seem mostly consisten with the statistical results of corpus-based research on Korean (and Japanese), this model does not accurately account for the Korean data. We argue that subject and object bareness (the lack of a functional particle) regularly correlates with interpretive effects that should be captured in terms of information structure (focus structure). Adapting Erteschik-Shir's (1997, 2007) framework to represent focus-structure, we argue that bare subjects and objects in Korean fail to be visible at this level. Consequently, they may be construed neither as active topics nor as foci, and thus must either be left out of focus-structure or incorporated within larger focus-structure constituents in order to be interpreted. We show that bare objects are never construed as topics or foci and alwas exhibit a form of semantic incorporation, whicle LEUL-marked objects always stand for focus-structre constituents construed as focused at some level. Bare subjects, unlike NEUN-marked topical subjects and GA-marked subjects, can be construed neither as active topics nor as foci, and always occur in tense-deficient clauses construed as thetic and anchored to speech time. We argue that our assumptions correctly predict the results of corpus studies, and we suggest that as regards nominal arguments, F-structure visibility might ultimately stand as the crucial interpretive correlate of Functional positions in syntax.},

  abstract = {This paper presents reevaluation of the choice between the two analyses for German partial fronting phenomena proposed in the literature, remnant movement and reanalysis. We show that the empirical arguments which were presented in favor of an extraction analysis are not convincing, and we provide empirical evidence supporting a reanalysis-like approach. Turning to a detailed data discussion, we compare three different kinds of partial constituents: verbal, adjectival, and nominal ones. Adjectival complements pattern with coherently selected verbal complements whereas nominal complements turn out to be less restricted. On the theoretical side, we show that a reanalysis-like theory can be given a formally precise rendering in the HPSG architecture in terms of a lexical argument-raising specification, which is already widely employed in HPSG analyses of coherence in Germanic and restructuring verbs in Romance languages. The account we propose generalizes previous HPSG approaches to partial complements of different categories and correctly predicts the interaction of (partial) VP topicalization with embedded partial NPs or APs.},

It discusses whether or not natural language employs a temporal system that explicitly quantifies over times at the level where semantic interpretation takes place. I first argue that a single-index theory is not empirically adequate for natural language. I then pro- pose a system in which times are syntactically represented. The system works in such a way that tense morphemes saturate the time argument slots of the predicates they attach to. Consequently it predicts that only the times of the main tensed predicates of clauses are accessible. Empirical evidence is presented showing such a distinction between tenseless and tensed predicates in terms of the accessibility to the times introduced by them.},

The distribution patterns of the functions of wa (contrastive or not) and ga (exhaustive listing or not) in independent as well as embedded clauses are described as manifestations of the distinction between judgments and propositions. Contrastive reading concerns propositions while exhaustive listing reading is a matter of judgments. The claim that wa sentences express categorical judgments and nonwa sentences, whether with a SL or IL predicate, express descriptions (thetic judgments in the extended sense) is elaborated. This extension is justified on the ground that a cognitive act expressed by a non-wa sentence is affirming, as opposed to asserting, an act expressed by a categorical judgment. Finally, it is claimed that the maximality constraint imposed on descriptions accounts for the exhaustive listing implicature associated with ga.},

  title = {Gradient {{Prosody}} in {{Japanese}}},
  volume = {14},
  abstract = {This paper examines five independent morphological processes in contemporary Japanese: renyookei reduplication, dvandva compounds, plural reduplication, mimetic reduplication, and zuuzya-go. Common to them is that the resulting form can be divided into two portions (e.g., base and reduplicant, or two members of a compound). Some of the morphological processes exhibit prosodic augmentation through vowel lengthening or segmental epenthesis, but others do not. Among the group of those phenomena with prosodic augmentation, the augmentation is shared by the two halves of a produced word in one case but not in others. Given these two parameters, the five morphological operations display a three-way gradient pattern: (i) both prosodic augmentation and prosodic sharing occur (renyookei reduplication), (ii) neither occurs (dvandva compounds and plural reduplication), and finally, (iii) prosodic augmentation occurs, but it is not shared by the two halves of a word (mimetic reduplication and zuuzya-go). This paper has both descriptive and theoretical goals. First, I demonstrate that prosody of the five morphological constructions exhibits such a gradient pattern through a careful description. Second, on the theoretical side, I offer a detailed comprehensive analysis of the prosodic gradation within the framework of Optimality Theory (Prince and Smolensky (1993)). I argue that the notion of relativized faithfulness is essential, relativization referring to morphemes. This intra-linguistic comparative study thus lends support to Kurisu (2001b; 2005) who argues for the necessity of morpheme-specific faithfulness constraints.},

This article shows that head-final structures derive the correct scope readings in scrambled clauses in a straightforward and consisten manner, whereas head-initial structures require more coplicated and sometimes contradictory assumptions.

We asked whether the classification of nouns by shape affects the degree to which Chinese speakers rely on shape when classifying objects.

Across all three experiments, Chinese speakers made significantly more shape choices than English speakers though they both mostly classified objects on the basis of taxonomic or functional similarity. Reliance on shape by speakers of Chinese was correlated with amount of exposure to Chinese. The results offer evidence in support of the idea that language influences categorization, or a weak form of the Whorf Hypothesis. The results also call into question the widely-held belief that speakers of all classifier languages pay less attention to shape in classification.},

Thus, the semantic arguments against the pseudo-cleft analysis for Malagasy are not conclusive. Finally, on the basis of comparative evidence from Tagalog, it is suggested that the structure of adjunct-focus in Malagasy may actually be quite different from that of subject-focus, even though both constructions must satisfy the same morphological constraints.},

Restrictions on the predicate, tense-marking on locatives and PPs, multiple occurrence of adverbs, binding into PPs as well as coordination are shown to be most problematic for the pseudo-cleft account according to which the clefted phrase is the predicate and what follows it is the DP subject with an empty head noun. The obligatory empty head noun, the non-DP distribution of the suggested DP subject, clefting of adjuncts and long-distance dependency are also troublesome for this view. These facts can be straightforwardly accommodated in the clausal complement analysis in which the cleft construction has a structure in which an empty copula verb takes as complement a functional projection headed by the focus particle no, and the clefted phrase is fronted to its surface position. Certain facts concerning discontinuous phrases and the adverb daholo `all' ostensibly support the clefted phrase being the predicate, but turn out to have no specific bearing on the cleft construction.},

  abstract = {It is commonly assumed that the English interrogative/relative pronoun whom is parallel to him and them in manifesting objective pronominal Case. We argue instead that whom is not CAse-marked along with these pronouns. Rather, its Case marking follows a different paradigm. Whom in modern English derives from a set of extragrammatical rules called 'grammatical viruses'. Speakers call upon such rules to check Case and (possibly) agreement features which the normal system of syntax cannot check but which prestige usage demands. Sentences with whom are typical of sentences resulting from grammatical viruses. Such virus-licensed products have a 'prestige' status, they are not typical of child language, and the intuitions about their use are strikingly different from intuitions about the use of other grammatical elements that they are traditionally claimed to wrok along the lines of. In the latter instance, intuitions about the use of ehom differ markely from intuitions about the use of ACC personal pronouns.},

  volume = {28},
  abstract = {This paper argues that truth values of sentences containing predicates of ``personal taste'' such as fun or tasty must be relativized to individuals. This relativization is of truth value only, and does not involve a relativization of semantic content: If you say roller coasters are fun, and I say they are not, I am negating the same content which you assert, and directly contradicting you. Nonetheless, both our utterances can be true (relative to their separate contexts). A formal semantic theory is presented which gives this result by introducing an individual index, analogous to the world and time indices commonly used, and by treating the pragmatic context as supplying a particular value for this index. The context supplies this value in the derivation of truth values from content, not in the derivation of content from character. Predicates of personal taste therefore display a kind of contextual variation in interpretation which is unlike the familiar variation exhibited by pronouns and other indexicals. Most of the work for this paper was completed before I became aware of K\"olbel (2002), which argues for a very similar position (though without the Kaplan-style formalization I develop here). Readers are referred to K\"olbel's book for a fuller philosophical defense of this position, and for programmatic suggestions of a slightly different approach to formal implementation.},

On one reading, the temporal adjective modifies the common noun (N-modifying reading). On the other, it modifies the possession relation (POSS-modifying reading). An explanation for this behavior is offered that appeals to what occurs in possessive sentences like John has a former car (N-modifying reading) and John formerly had a car (POSS-modifying reading). In the sentential cases, the source of two readings is two distinct, modifiable phrases. Given the parallels, we propose a structure for possessive nominals analogous to that of possessive clauses. Specifically, we argue that such nominals include a locative small-clause structure, following Freeze (1992), and we explain the ambiguity structurally, as a simple matter of where temporal adjectives attach (NP vs. PP). We show that this analysis provides a straightforward basis for the semantic composition of possessive nominals.},

  abstract = {Chomsky (1959a) presented an algorithm for constructing a finite transducer that is strongly equivalent to a Chomsky-normal-form context-free grammar for all sentences generated by that grammar with up to any specified finite degree of center embedding. This article presents a new solution using a variety of COORDINATE GRAMMAR to assign nonembedding (paratactic) structures strongly equivalent to those assigned by an embedding grammar, which can in turn be directly computed by a finite transducer. It proposes that the bound on center embedding is really a consequence of a bound on alternation between right and left embedding, called here ZIGZAG EMBEDDING. Coordinate grammars can also be used to assign on embedding structures equivalent to those with up to any specified finite degree of coordinate embedding (the occurrence of a coordinate structure as a member of a coordinate structure of the same type). It concludes that coordinate grammars or the finite transducers strongly equivalent to them are psychologically real, and that the existence of a finite bound on the degree of zigzag and coordinate embedding is a consequence of the increasing size and complexity of such grammars or transducers as the bound increases.},

(b) These features are ordered on lexical items. (c) All phrases are phases. (d) Edge features that trigger intermediate movement steps can only be added before the phase head becomes inert. Given (a\textendash{}d), it follows from the PIC that extraction from XP is blocked if the operation that has merged XP is the final operation taking place in a phase: a last-merged specifier is a barrier because no edge feature can be inserted that might extract some item out of it; this induces a PIC violation on the following cycle. The analysis can be extended to cover freezing effects. Furthermore, it predicts the existence of the melting effect, illustrated in German and Czech: local scrambling in front of what would otherwise qualify as a last-merged specifier renders the specifier transparent for extraction. The most important assumption made here is that the timing of edge feature insertion is crucial (before vs. after in (d)). Accordingly, the analysis can be viewed as an argument supporting a strictly derivational organization of grammar.},

It also addresses the differences among the interpretations of the three indefinite generic nominals. The background assumptions are: (i) natural languages make use of both kind-referring expressions and generic quantification to express genericity (see Krifka et al. (1995)); (ii) indefinites are variables (see Heim (1982)). I show that in BP singular and plural definite generics are kind-referring expressions, whereas indefinite generics are heimian indefinites participating on generic quantification. The apper claims that common nouns in BP are number-neutral. They denote both atomic an dplural individuals. To account for the fact that number morphology has semantic import in BP, I argue that number morphemes are operators on noun phrase denotations in this language. When the SING(ular) operator applies to a NP, the result is a set of atomic individuals. When the PL(ural) operator applies to a NP, its denotation is stripped of its atomic entities. The different interpretations of indefinites arise through the interaction of the denotation of common nouns, the semantics of number operators and generic quantification.},

  volume = {17},
  abstract = {In spite of a powerful preference for bisyllabicity identified in previous research on loanword truncation in Cantonese, more new forms are increasingly found which have been truncated down to a monosyllable. An examination of a 1,400-word corpus of Cantonese loanwords collected over a span of 50 years reveals a significant increase in the number of loan verbs and adjectives in more recent times, as opposed to the almost exclusive adoption of nouns previously. Verbs, as opposed to nouns, are found to be much more prone to undergoing ``monosyllabic truncation.'' This is found to stem from an asymmetry between nouns and verbs in the native language. A preference for monosyllabicity, particularly in the case of verbs and adjectives, is confirmed via a study of a Cantonese translation of the Swadesh word list. A further investigation of a corpus of everyday conversations uncovers lexical statistics that may have been mirrored in the truncation process. Finally, the greater readiness for the importation of verbs in more recent times is explained in terms of Haugen's ``stages of bilingualism.''},

These are all and only the possibilities expected under recent restrictive theories of phrase structure, like the one advocated by Kayne (1994), and are exactly those empirically realized. Evidence for this conclusion is based primarily on the (existential/generic) interpretation of bare nouns and overt indefinites and is reinforced by extraction considerations. The whole analysis, based on the interpretation of Romance indefinites, is likely to support some version of Diesing's (1992) Mapping Hypothesis even more strongly than previous types of evidence did, including the original data from Germanic languages.},

  volume = {9},
  abstract = {One of the two central suggestions put forth in Longobardi (1991, 1994) was that Romance/English differences in the syntax of proper names were parametrically connected to supposed differences in teh semantics of bare (plural and mass) common nouns (BNs). The present article will pursue this line of investigation, trying to make precise such meaning differences and to understand the reason for their apparently surprising parametric association with the syntax of proper names. It will be shown that in most Romance varieties BNs, unlike their English coutnerparts, distribute their existential and generic readings across all different contexts exactly like (Romance and English) overt indefinties. All the differences will be unified under the proposal that Romance BNs are nothing but a type of indefinites (variables, existentially or generically bound) in Kamp-Heim's DRT sense, while English BNs are rather systematically ambiguous between this quantificational interpretation and a referential (i.e. directly kind-denoting, much in the spirit of Carlson 1977a,b) one, providing for another type of generic reading. The analysis will therefore crucially exploit and empirically support Gerstner and Krifka's (1987) distinction between referential and quantificational genericity. On such grounds we will finally gain a conceptual understanding of the typological implication originally established in Longobardi (1991, 1994), thus confirming that the strategies of interpretation of nominals, whether proper or common nouns, are basically one and the same, though differently parametrized in different languages. This result, in turn, will shed some light on the question whether comparative semantics is possible and whether it can be singled out as a legitimate independent component of parametric theories of grammatical variation.},

Here I suggest a radically different viewpoint (the Inertial Theory of diachronic sytnax), namely, that syntactic change not provably due to interference should not occur at all as a primitive \textendash{} that is, unless ofrced by changes in the phonology, the semantics, or the lexicon, perhaps ultimately by interface or grammar-external pressures, in line with the minimalist enterprise in synchronic linguistics.

But the ordered representation cannot account for anti-edge effects: those rules which involve the nonadjacent value of [cont]. Moreover, it predicts that ordering of the gestures is a possible phonological contrast, but this is incorrect, as no language has [+cont][-cont] single segments. As predicted by the unordered representation, all apparent cases of phonological edge effects can simply be stated as rules referring to a value of [cont]; all rules which show true edge effects occur after the values are phonetically ordered.},

The interaction of positional faithfulness and markedness is shown to result in laryngeal neutralization. Regressive assimilation is shown to be a result of the interaction of positional faithfulness with a constraint preferring adjacent obstruents to agree in voicing. Rerankings of the proposed constraints account for attested pataterns of voicing assimilation and neutralization: unlike previous neutralization and spread analyses, this approach makes the correct prediction that it is equally natural for voicing assimilation in clusters to combine with either devoicing of or retention of voicing distinctions in word-final consonants. It is argued that the interactions of these constraints account for why voicing assimilation is always regressive unless special circumstances hold.},

The latter theory provides prepresentations that, to a strking degree, are adequate for a description of three acquisitional stages in our data: monosyllabic words, polysyllabic words, and words containing the accurate adult number of syllables. Output such as 'nat', 'ojnat', and 'ojinat' for olifant represent precisly these three stages. The first of these examples shows that the child is right-oriented in his monosyllabic stage, selecting rightmost stressed (gridmarked) syllables. Words then become longer by the addition of further syllables that are gridmarked in the metrical representaitons. Finally, the adult stage is reached in which all target syllables are rrepresented. The second part of this article concerns a phenomenon we call mutation. In mutation, all continuants are consistently replaced witn n- in onsets. We show how this phenomenon depnds on both syllable structure and stress, discuss the possible role of exhaustive footing and strict binarity of feet, and present evidenc for the view that its details provide support for a Stress-to-Weight principle, which is currently under discussion in the metrical literature.},

We use a more precise formulation of this idea to make several predictions about the distribution of particles based on teh size of hte object NP and the semantic dependencies among the verb, the particle, and the object. Corpus studies confirm the predictions, providing evidence for the principle of domain minimization.},

Adult Catalan does not allow neutral preverbal objects whereas early Catalan seems to allow objects preceding verbs in the very early stages. We analyse the OV sequences found in our data and show how these only show up co-occuring with a certain type of verbs, namely, `telic' verbs. In line with this observation we propose that aspect is a crucial feature of these sequences projecting whenever one of these verbs is selected and providing a landing site for object movement. Another part of the analysis of the OV constructions implies noticing that the morphological make-up of the verbal elements is not always non-finite. The alternation that we observe between VO-OV constructions seems to be determined by the verb type but it is only fully accounted for if we allow for a framework in which the AGR parameter is not yet set. This possibility follows from the bilingualism proposal in Roeper (1999) where child language permits different grammars to co-exist in a particular stage. In the case under consideration the AGR feature would be allowed to have two values and thus the verb would not raise obligatorily.},

  volume = {15},
  abstract = {Twocase studies are presented of two monolingual Spanish children (ages 1;5 to 2;2 and 1;3 to 2;3) focusing on the acquisition of syllable final consonants, here analyzed as codas. On the basis of target Spanish it is predicted that word final codas should be acquired before word medial codas, because the former are often coronal, i.e., unspecified for Place, and the latter are linked to the following onset, which involves some representational complexity. Moreover, if morphological factors play an important role in early acquisition, final codas, corresponding to plurals and to verbal endings, should be favored over medial codas. The results instead show a clear preference for medial over final codas. Codas of function words, i.e., articles, are favored as well. The analysis shows that these results are due to the prosodic and rhythmic structure of the language and relates syllable development to prosodic and rhythmic development as well as to the development of function words. The preferred foot in adult as well as in early Spanish is the trochee, and many of the function words receive a secondary stress. It is thus argued that a stressed syllable, being the head of a foot, licenses codas in early acquisition. For the two children presented here, prosody paves the way to morphology.},

In Jingpo, a Tibeto-Burman language, demonstratives which are inflected for number show relative freedom in syntactic distribution. Singular demonstratives can occur either prenominally, postnominally or appear twice to sandwich the head noun. Plural demonstratives can only occur postnominally. The relative freedom shown in the syntactic distribution of Jingpo demonstratives is accounted for in the present paper with the proposal that demonstratives in the right peripheral of the nominal phrase are D-type demonstratives and demonstratives adjacent to the head noun are A(djective)-type demonstratives. The analysis thus calls for a non-unitary treatment of demonstratives.},

This paper considers the ba construction from an aspectual point of view. I argue that the ba predicate describes a bounded event. Whether an event is bounded in Chinese may depend on situation type only, or it may depend on both situation type and the aspect a situation is rpesented in. As for the ba NP, it is specific in the sense of Liu (1990). I further argue that the two properties \textendash{} boundedness and specificity \textendash{} are related. There is a dependency between the ba argument denotations and the event described by the predicate, and this dependency can be characterized in terms of a structure-preserving funciton \textendash{} a homomorphism. The relation preserved is the 'all of' relation. On this view boundedness and spcificity are simply different manifestations of the same property that is inherent in the meaning of a ba predicate. The ba construction is thus shown to be an example of how aspectual considerations constrain both the predicate and an NP argument in Chinese.},

Pure identity shown by the anphor $\backslash$emphziji-benshen 'self-self' can be derivable from the semanti composition of the near reflexive funtion of the morpheme z$\backslash$emphiji 'self', the focus function of the morpheme $\backslash$emphbenshen 'self' and the operator status of $\backslash$emphziji-benshen 'self-self' while near identity (or near reflexivity) wshown by the $\backslash$emphnon-X-benshen 'non-X-self' anaphor is due to its being"a pronoun in coreference." In other words, in Chinese pure identity is near reflexivity plus a focus marker which picks out the best representation of the antecedent that happens to be the actual person. Thus, the $\backslash$emphX-benshen 'X-self' anaphor should not be considered a pure anaphor without content. Typologically, there are two ways for human languages to get pure identity: One is by using an anaphorwithout content; the other is by using a focus marker that picks out the best representation of the antecedent which happens to be the actual person. The typological difference in establishing pure identity provides an answer for the long standing question of why the notion of coargumenthood is often adopted by linguists in defining binding conditions in languages which show an antilocality effect but seldom in Chinese. The distribution and coindexation of all Chinese anaphors, either the $\backslash$emphX-bensen 'X-self' or the $\backslash$emphnon-X-benshen 'non-X-self' anaphor, are determined by one single syntactic condition, namely, the traditional binding theory, regardless of whether they are inside or outside the coargument domain. In contrast, in languages which show an antlocality effect, the binding theory allows both pure and near anaphors within the coargument domain but Condition R filters out one of them in the absence of lexical/morphological reflexivity; however, outside the coargument domain, the binding theory itself governs the distribution and coindexation of all anaphors.},

I believe that there are at least two types of null objects in Chinese, namely the EA and teh variable. The former must occur in a pragmatically oriented environment where a pragmatically downgraded internal protagonisted antecedent is available while the latter may occur in a pragmatically neurtral environment. Seen in this way, Xu's examples at first sight appear to be problematic for Huang's (1982, 1984a,b and 1987) Null Topic Analysis, but upon closer scrutiny turn out not to apply the Empty Antilogophoric Analysis of the Chinese null object in Xu's examples has two theoretical and empirical implicaitons: first, the proposal is reminiscent of Dubinsky and Hamilton's (1998) Antilogophoric Analysis of English epithets; this further implies that Hunag's (1991) Null Epithet Analysis of null objects, whcih suggests that the Chinese null object is the null counterpart of epithets subject to Binding Condition C, is inadequate. Second, the patterns observed may indicate that there are at least three types of antilogophrs in Chinese; these are not independent of each other but represent different degrees of directness in which antilogophoric attitutdes manifest themselves.},

In this type of scope marking system, a wh-element in an embedded adjunct clause takes matrix scope when it occurs in a clause that syntactically and semantically modifies a wh-phrase in the matrix. These facts provide unambiguous evidence for the indirect dependency approach to wh-scope marking advocated by Dayal (1994, 2000) where the embedded question provides a semantic restriction for thematrix whelement. Dayal's theory will be extended to provide a compositional analysis of these constructions.

A mid vowel preceded by a front rounded glide [ h], however, is only partially assimilated, resulting in a front unrounded [e] rather than the expected front rounded [o/]. This process of Mid Vowel Assimilation varies across Mandarin dialects depending on the features involved, the direction of feature spreading, and whether or not a mid vowel is fully or partially assimilated. This article proposes a unified constraint-based account of the variation and typology of Mid Vowel Assimilation across Mandarin dialects. Couched within Optimality Theory (Prince and Smolensky 1993) and Feature Class Theory (Padgett 1995, 1996), the proposed analysis demon- strates (i) how the interaction of gradient assimilation-related constraints and markedness constraints on feature cooccurrence avoids marked segment types and produces partial assimilation effects, and (ii) how different rankings of the proposed set of constraints generate the variation pattern across Mandarin dialects. To fully account for the typology of Mandarin Mid Vowel Assimilation and the uneven dis- tribution of different types of Mid Vowel Assimilation, I suggest that (i) some assimilation-related constraints can be categorically assessed as a marked option, and (ii) some constraint rankings on markedness, while not universally fixed, can be designated as universal default rankings.},

  volume = {12},
  abstract = {This paper discusses how Chinese, a so-called tenseless language, determines its temporal reference. For simplex sentences without time adverbs or aspectual marker, I show that temporal reference is correlated with aktionsart or grammatical viewpoint. For sentences with an aspecual marker, I discuss the temporal semantics of 'le' and 'guo' in detail, showing how their tense/aspectual meanings contribute to temporal reference. I propose to analyze 'le' as an event realization operator and 'guo' as ananteriority operator. For subordinate clauses, I show that temporal reference of complement clauses of verbs is basically determined by verbal semantics of individual verbs, which may impose some temporal restriction on the temporal location of the embedded event. As for relative clauses and temporal adverbial clauses, many different factors such as lexical verbal semantics, referential properties of determiners, lifteme effect of noun phrases, semantic or pragmatics constraints on termporal connectives, inference rules and world knowledge, etc., all interact to help determine temporal reference. Many data discussed in this paper indicate that there is no evidence of (covert) tenses in Chinese. Therefore, challenging work remains for those who have claimed that Tnese Phrase is projected in Chinese phrase structures.},

  volume = {27},
  abstract = {A recent popular analysis of English indefinites isthat they involve a choice function mechanism in their semantic interpretation. However,there are diversified views regarding how intermediate scope readings should be dealt withand which level(s) existential closure should apply to. This paper attempts to make acontribution to this debate by examining existential polarity wh-phrases in Chinese. I showthat unlike the behaviors of polarity indefinites in St''\'at''imcets reported by Matthewson(1999), intermediate scope readings are possible for polarity wh-phrases in Chinese but aresubject to some locality conditions. I suggest that implicit arguments of choice functionsmight have a parametric value the choice of which affects availability of intermediate readings.The findings in this paper thus revive the possibility, rejected by Matthewson (1999), that thechoice function mechanism may vary from language to language or from indefinite NPs in onelanguage to indefinite NPs in another language or even from one type of indefiniteNP to another type of indefinite NP within the same language.},

This syntactic analysis allows one to combine into one phrase various compared constituents that would otherwise not be analyzed as forming a phrase by themselves. Semantically, in extension of work by Heim as well as Bhatt and Takahashi, ba is taken to compare two sequences of arguments of a gradable predicate along the dimension given by that predicate. It is also suggested that comparatives across languages may be subject to three parameters: (i) argument-dependent comparison vs. non-argument dependent comparison, (ii) phrasal comparison vs. clausal comparison, and (iii) monoadic comparison vs. dyadic comparison.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates tone sandhi phenomena in the Chinese dialect of Tianjin, which are noteworthy for the rule application direc- tionalities observed in tri-tonal strings. The rule application directionalities appear to be ungoverned, as none of the principles proposed to date that may contribute to determining directionalities can account for them. Based on the constraint-based theory of OT, this paper shows that the rule operation directionalities in Tianjin are by no means ungoverned. Normally tone sandhi applies from left to right for identity reasons. This is captured by the OO-faithfulness constraint IDENT-BOT, which requires identity between prosodically related outputs. The left-to-right directionality is sacrificed only when it would result in output forms that involve marked sequences or toneme deletion at the prominent edge of a tone, which are for- bidden by the markedness constraint OCP-T and the positional IO-faithfulness constraint MAX-IO-t-R, respectively. Thus the rule application directionalities in Tianjin are naturally predicted by the interaction of IDENT-BOT, OCP-T, and MAX-IO-t-R, where IDENT-BOT must be dominated by the latter two con- straints.},

In this article, we present experimental evidence from children learning English and Kannada demonstrating that children's indefinites show scopal restrictions parallel to the restrictions they show with other unambiguously quantificational expressions. Children, unlike adults, show a strong preference to assign quantificational expressions surface scope. This is true for both strong and weak quantifiers, which would be surprising on a theory of indefinites that treated these expressions as uniformly nonquantificational. Consequently, we argue that in adult grammars indefinites must have a quantificational representation at least some of the time.},

  abstract = {The standard view of superlatives treats them as a subkind of adjectives. However, in many languages, superlatives require the presence of a determiner, even in the predicate position. This leads to an apparent contradiction, since it is independently known that determiners syntactically combine with extended NP projections and are excluded with APs. This issue is resolved if superlative adjectives always appear in an attributive (modificational) position. Superlative phrases without an overt noun (e.g., in the predicative position) modify a null head noun. I show that this hypothesis immediately explains the restrictions on the distribution of superlatives in languages as diverse as Russian, French, German, Dutch, Breton, Spanish and Portuguese. I propose that the modificational nature of superlative adjectives can be derived from their semantics, and I argue that such a proposal yields a natural explanation of the behavior of superlatives in Hebrew and Persian. Finally, I discuss the interaction between this theory and the standard, movement-based analyses of comparatives and superlatives and provide an explanation for apparent counterexamples.},

  abstract = {This paper argues, on the basis of data from St'\'at'imcets (Lillooet Salish), for a theory of wide-scope indefinites which is similar, though not identical, to that proposed by Kratzer (1989). I show that a subset of St'\'at'imcets indefinites takes obligatory wide scope with respect to if-clauses, negation and modals, and is unable to be distrbuted over by quantificational phrases. These wide-scope effects cannot be accounted for by movement, but require an analysis involving choice functions (Reinhart 1995, 1997). However, Reinhart's particular choice function analysis is unable to account for the St'\'at'imcets data. A Kratzer-style theory, on the other hand, accounts not only for the wide-scope effects, but also for the emergence of narrower-than-widest interpretations for indefinites which contain bound variables. I depart from Kratzer's analysis in claiming that St'\'at'imcets choice function indefinites are not 'specific'; the discourse context does not provide a value for the function variable. Therefore, I utilize wide-scope existential closure over choice functions rather than leaving the variables free. However, my analysis provides support for Kratzer's claim that Enlgish indefinites are ambiguous between a choice function interpretation and a quantificational interpretation, since St'\'at'imcets determiners overtly encode the English ambiguity. I conclude by suggesting that the proposed analysis of wide-scoep indefinites may be universally valid.},

The goal of this paper is to subject these beliefs to crosslinguistic scrutiny. I begin by showing that in St'at'imcets (Lillooet Salish), quantifiers always require sisters of argumental type, and the creation of a generalized quantifier from an NP predicate always proceeds in two steps rather than one. I then explicitly adopt the strong null hypothesis that the denotations of quantifiers should be crosslinguistically uniform. Since the Salish data cannot be captured by the usual analysis of English, I pursue the idea that English is reducible to the Salish pattern. Reanalysis of many English constructions is required. I argue that the reanalysis has advantages over the standard analysis for partitives, as well as for non-partitive all- and most-phrases, which I analyze as containing bare plurals of argumental type. Even where the new analysis faces some challenges (for example, with every), the attempt still leads to fruitful results. It forces us to view familiar constructions in a new light, and to redefine, I believe correctly, which quantificational constructions are 'basic' and which stand in need of further explanation.},

In the Jieyang variety, the passive marker k'eG derived from the verb `give' requires an agent, a requirement which we relate to the subcategorization of the lexical verb `give'. We show that the same morpheme is used with unaccusative verbs in the form [k'eG i V], where i is an expletive pronominal: it cannot encode an agent because the unaccusative predicates concerned lack an agent argument. Therefore what appears to be a passive marker with agent in fact constitutes overt coding of unaccusativity, of a kind unusual in Chinese dialects but paralleled in several Indo-European languages. The passive and unaccusative constructions are shown to share thematic and aspectual properties: the surface subject carries the role of theme or patient, and the predicate denotes a change of state, hence the requirement for a resultative verbal complement (RVC). The [k'eG i V-RVC] construction is shown to involve formation of an unaccusative complex predicate, with the RVC contributing a change of state component to the aspectuality of the predicate.},

There are two types of tonal patterns that may occur in an NJ word: Type A tone (a fall pitch pattern) and Type B tone (a non-fall pitch pattern). Previous studies on ongoing tonal changes in Kagoshima Japanese (KJ), which has a tonal system similar to that of NJ, revealed that accented words in Tokyo Japanese (TJ) are realized as Type A tones and unaccented words in TJ are realized as Type B tones in KJ. In contrast, a loanword in NJ is realized as a Type A tone if the loanword is accented on either of the first two morae in TJ; otherwise the loanword is realized as a Type B tone in NJ. This paper proposes that both NJ and KJ speakers have TJ forms as input, but only NJ speakers delete an accent on the third or later mora during the adaptation process. The proposal accounts for the tonal neutralization of compounds in NJ, which occurs when the first member contains three or more morae.},

  abstract = {Drawing on Hoekstra's (1988f) work on so-called `small clause results' and Marantz's (1992) work on the $\backslash$emphway-construction and its relation to resultative constructions, in this article I argue my way to the conclusion that the so-called `direct object restriction' (DOR) on English resultatives must be reinstated, despite Rappaport Hovav and Levin's (2001) claims to the contrary. Firs, I review some of the main properties of resultative construcions that appear to motivate the syntactic approach, whose main descriptive tenet is the DOR. In particular, I show that the present analysis of the conflation process involved in the formation of complex resultatives allows us to offer an adequate explanation of their syntactic properties. Second, I put forward a relational syntactic analysis of the so-called `$\backslash$emphway-construction'. In particular, I show that the present analysis helps us understand why the DOR holds for this idiomatic resultative-like construction as well. Finally, I deal with some exceptional cases put forward by Verspoor (1997) and Wechsler (1997), reviewed by Rappaport Hovav and Levin (2001), which appear to contradict the DOR.},

  title = {Pseudo {{Noun Incorporation}} in {{Niuean}}},
  volume = {19},
  abstract = {This paper examines a phenomenon of Niuean (Oceanic) often called Noun Incorporation (NI). It is shown that, since nominal element in these constructions is a phrase (NP) rathern than a head (N), this phenomenon does not in fact constitute NI in the normal sense of the term. Instead, it is termned Pseudo Noun Incorporation, or PNI. An analysis is presented in which an object NP (rther than DP) is generated adjacent to a verb. Since NP cannot check absolutive case, it fails to move out of VP, hence it undergoes predicate fronting along with the verb to derive the 'incorporated' order V-O-Particles-S-X: the normal order is V-Particles-S-O-X. The properties of three subtypes of PNI are examined in some detail: general PNI. existential PNI, and instrumental PNI, and the analysis is developed to account for their properties. General PNI involves the generation of an NP object, in which the referential position remains open, resulting in a habitual reading for the sentence. Instrumental PNI is similar, except it does not have the same aspectual consequence. In existential PNI, on the other hand, an existential verb (fai 'have/be', muhu 'have plenty/be plentiful') binds the position in NP, thus allowing the NP to be referential and to be modifed by a relative clause. Existential PNI thus results from a hybrid V/DET category (such as fai) which simultaneously beinds the open position in NP and acts as the head predicate of the sentence. We see that the properties of Niuean PNI do not fit into the various typologies of NI available in the literature, hence a novel analysis is required, such as the one proposed in this paper.},

In other cases, TETU effects are insufficient, and lexical ordering determines the preference for dominant allomorphs.},

Our study is based on the analysis of an extensive database comprising a wide range of seventeenth-, eighteenth-, nineteenth-, and early twentieth-century sources providing information on the typical features of nonstandard spoken European and Quebec French. It reveals that ne deletion became widespread in nonstandard spoken French only in the nineteenth century and leads us to hypothesize that the affixal status of subject clitic pronouns contributed to the rise of ne deletion.},

These properties follow from the interaction between checking procedures (that is, V-to-I-to-C movement) and the location of the hypothetical infinitive in the sentence structure (that is, base-generated in Topic position). In this specific configuration, the effect of [+V] features on Tense combines with the modal feature of Complementizer and ensures finiteness to this clause, despite the infinitive form of the verb. This analysis offers a uniform account for hypothetical infinitives in Quebec and Continental French. It also predicts that cross-linguistic variation (for example, internal licensing of pro in subject position in Quebec French versus Continental French) must concern parametric settings (for example the Null Subject Parameter) which would further interact with the structural conditions of high infinitives discussed in this paper.},

That articulation was probably a flap [r], and it was part of the general erosion of the final stops that led to their gradual loss in northern Chinese.

According to Recanati (`Unarticulated Constituents', Linguistics and Philosophy, 25 (2002) 299), extra-linguistic context can have additional truth-conditional effects, in the form of optional pragmatic processes like `free enrichment'. This paper shows that Recanati's position is not warranted, since there is an alternative line of analysis that obviates the need to assume free enrichment. In the alternative analysis, we need Stanley's variables, but we need to give them the freedom to be or not to be generated in the syntax/present at logical form, a kind of optionality that has nothing to do with the pragmatics-related optionality of free enrichment.},

The availability of distributive scope in Japanese is modulated by word order and the semantic features of quantifiers. For English- speaking learners, these subtle interpretive phenomena are underdetermined in both the input and the L1. However, for Korean speakers, target-like knowledge could arise via L1 transfer. The results yield clear evidence of distinct developmental paths in the two L1 groups, testifying to L1 influence on the syntax-semantics interface. Nonetheless, some English-speaking learners exhibit target-like distributive readings despite the lack of direct evidence. This development of target-like knowledge in the absence of evidence is accounted for by integrating Sprouse's (2006) lexical transfer account of L2 acquisition and a Universal Grammar model (Beghelli 1995) of distributive scope.},

This process, hitherto termed "intensive" reduplication, has previously been analyzed as involving prefixation.

McCarthy and Prince (1995) attempt to account for this divergent behavior by invoking base-reduplicant faithfulness; Zoll (2002) attributes it to a stem-internal/stem-external distinction among prefixes. Based on phonological and semantic criteria, our analysis presolves intensive reduplication into several classes, including both prefixing and suffixing types. This analysis improves empirical coverage over previous accounts while minimizing assumptions and demonstrates that careful morphological and phonological analysis can distinguish between prefixing and suffixing copying in cases of seemingly ambiguous total reduplication.},

Departing from much generative work, it is argued that languages can lack abstract Case and/or abstract Agreement. By modifying several Minimalist assumptions, it is demonstrated that languages without Case, but with Agreement will require overt NPs to appear in non-argumental, dislocated positions. These are exemplified by Mohawk and Kinande. In contrast, languages with Case features may allow, but not require NP dislocation. These are exemplified by all of the Indo-European languages and Japanese. Finally, languages that lack both Case and Agreement are predicted to have a rigid word order. Chinese is used as an example of such a language. In addition, the paper addresses a number of phenomena that pose a problem for the view that Case and Agreement are universal and are better understood if these properties are taken to vary parametrically. The phenomena include locative inversion and inverse voice constructions in Bantu languages, the distribution of subject anaphors in Japanese, and the non co-occurrence of overt accusative case with overt object agreement.},

The study aims at showing that the full range of interpretations can be derived within a rigid account of lexical and compositional semantics. Locative modifiers are invariably treated as first-order predicates adding a locative constraint. All semantic differences originate from the structural environment they are embedded in and the pragmatic resolution of semantic indeterminacy. The syntactic distribution of locative modifiers is shown to be derivable from interface conditions.},

  title = {A {{Theory}} of {{Individual}}-{{Level Predicates Based}} on {{Blind Mandatory Scalar Implicatures}}},
  volume = {17},
  abstract = {Predicates such as tall or to know Latin, which intuitively denote permanent properties, are called individual-level predicates. Many peculiar prop- erties of this class of predicates have been noted in the literature. One such property is that we cannot say \#John is sometimes tall. Here is a way to account for this property: this sentence sounds odd because it triggers the scalar implicature that the alternative John is always tall is false, which cannot be, given that, if John is sometimes tall, then he always is. This intuition faces two challenges. First: this scalar implicature has a weird nature, since it must be surprisingly robust (other- wise, it could be cancelled and the sentence rescued) and furthermore blind to the common knowledge that tallness is a permanent property (since this piece of common knowledge makes the two alternatives equivalent). Second: it is not clear how this intuition could be extended to other, more complicated properties of individual-level predicates. The goal of this paper is to defend the idea of an implicature-based theory of individual-level predicates by facing these two chal- lenges. In the first part of the paper, I try to make sense of the weird nature of these special mismatching implicatures within the recent grammatical framework for scalar implicatures of Chierchia (Structures and beyond, 2004) and Fox (2007). In the second part of the paper, I show how this implicature-based line of reasoning can be extended to more complicated properties of individual-level predicates, such as restrictions on the interpretation of their bare plural subjects, noted in Carlson (Reference to kinds in English. Doctoral dissertation, University of Massachusetts at Amherst, 1977), Milsark (Linguistic Analysis 3.1: 1\textendash{}29, 1977), and Fox (Natural Language Semantics 3: 283\textendash{}341, 1995); restrictions on German word order, noted in Diesing (Indefinites, 1992); and restrictions on Q-adverbs, noted in Kratzer (The Generic Book, ed. Carlson and Pelletier, 125\textendash{}175, 1995).},

Furthermore, the new approach is shown to account for other conspicuous properties of German V/2 constructions (concerning the internal islandhood and external distribution of V/2 clauses)and to be compatible with evidence involving constituency tests, mismatches between verb-final and V/2 clauses, and (apparently) complex prefields. The article concludes with remarks on how the analysis can be extended to other Germanic V/2 languages and V/1 and V/3 constructions and how the EPC can be derived from a more general identification requirement for phases.},

These properties present both typological and theoretical challenges, since agreement is generally regarded as a structural relation, realized morphologically as inflectional affixes on the verbal element. These challenges are addressed here by applying a particular componential analysis (along the lines of Jackendoff 1990) to the class of verbs which inflect for agreement in ISL. This analysis enables us to capture and explain the similarities as well as differences between the agreement systems of signed and spoken languages. It argues that agreement is basically a structural relation in languages in both modalities. The unique properties of sign language verb agreement are attributed tot he difference in the agreeing element: verbs and auxiliaries in spoken languages vs. a spatial predicate in sign languages. These conclusions have some significatn theoretical implications, both for capturing aspects ofthe interaction between modality and the structure of language, and for imposing restrictions ont he structure of the lexicon.},

It will be shown that in both cases, certain speaker-oriented adverbials or adjectives pattern much alike. They may be placed in a quasi-external position, in which they can be considered syntactic orphans. In particular, the adjectival construction has not really been discussed in the literature. Both\textemdash{}the investigated adverbials and adjectives\textemdash{}can also appear inside a clause (prefield) or within the noun phrase (i.e., between article and noun). The two relevant positions are associated with specific restrictions on the available readings. A possible explanation of these restrictions will be proposed. The results of the given analysis have some consequences for the architecture of the so-called interfaces, that is, the bridge character of the branch from core syntax to the morpho-phonological component on the one hand (PF in the broad sense), and the one between syntax proper and meaning (LF in a larger view) on the other.},

It is proposed that the sentential complement of these constructions dentoes an incomplete conditional and is explicitly or implicitly modalized, as if it were the consequent of a complete conditional. Enough, too, and so are quantifiers that relate an extent predicate and the incomplete conditional (expressed by the sentential complement) and are interpreted as comparisons between two extents. The first extent is the maximal extent of a set of extents that staisfy the (hidden) conditional, where the sentential complement supplies the consequent and the main clause th antecedent. This approach permits to predict 9a) the context-dependent interpretation of these constructions and (b) the duality relations between the degree words.},

We argue on the basis of a large-scale corpus study that the periphrastic construction with be was restricted to a stative resultative interpretation, whereas that with have developed a wider range of uses, crucially including the experiential perfect in addition to resultatives. Support comes from comparing the Earlier English patterns with related ones in Norwegian and German for which native-speaker judgments are available. On the basis of this insight, we propose distinct formal analyses for the two constructions and show how they account for the attested patterns and changes in Middle and Early Modern English. Of particular theoretical relevance is the premise that what has been called the ``perfect'' is not a homogeneous, monolithic category, and that certain kinds of variation can only be understood by teasing apart the pieces involved. Earlier English and German auxiliaries have distinct distributions because their ``perfects'' have distinct syntactic and semantic makeups.},

In these constructions a Wh-phrase moves to the specifier of a CP that is lower than the CP over which the Wh-phrase takes scope. In partial Wh-movement, the scope position contains a scope-marker, and in multiple Wh-movement, the scope position contains another Wh-phrase. Both constructions are restricted by a Subjacency-like constraint. It is argued that the data can be accounted for by considering Subjacency to be a condition on representation. In addition, it is claimed that Absorption applies at S-structure, as well as LF, in these languages, whereas in languages like English, it applies only at LF. The possibility of S-structure Absorption unifies partial and multiple Wh-movement and accounts for their existnece in a language.},

This metalogical set-up is used for handling propositional attitude verbs (limited to believe in this paper). We define a truth functions which determines the truth values p:t iff of an L-proposition p with respect to a theory T. Theories are sets of L-propositions with associated truth values, and can be viewed as a (much more well-defined) replacement for possible worlds. We develop a mechanism for defining belief worlds as theories. We simultaneously develop two different versions of our system \textendash{} a Boolean version where the set X of truth values is f0-1g, and a degree-truth version where X is the interval [0,1] of real numbers. We use degrees of truth in handling a broad class of semantic predicates that we call base\textendash{}focus predicates, which include generalized quantifiers as well as many adverb and adjective senses and certain discourse-level predicates.},

The theory is illustrated primarily by a comprehensive analysis of the Arabic broken plural; it is further supported by analysis of a number of processes from other languages, yielding a formal typology of domain-circumscription effects. The results obtained here depend on, and therefore confirm,two central principle of Prosodic Morphology: (1) the Prosodic Morphology Hypothesis, which requires that templates be expressed in prosodic, not segmental terms; and (2) the Template Satisfaction Condition, which requires that all elements in templates are satisfied obligatorily.},

On the contrary, I show that process-specific constraints are a natural and expected result of constraint ranking, the fundamental idea of OT. Furthermore, OT makes a restrictive prediction, the subset criterion, about coexistent process-specific constraints within a single grammar \textendash{} a prediction supported by the Palestinian material. Davis also presents evidence that epenthetic segments have featural specifications, claiming that OT says they are featureless. This is incorrect; OT is a model of constraint interaction, not of the representation of epenthetic segments.},

First, the shape differences between phases are quite diverse, involving resyllabificaiton, deletion, umlaut, and metathesis. Second, the phase alternation produces prosodic structures that are otherwise unattested in this language, replacing simple (C)V syllables with closed and diphthongal ones. In this article, I argue that Optimality Theory (Prince and Smolensky 1993) helps to make sense of both these observations.

The notion of scalarity, heretofore applicable only to adjectives, is extended to PPs, such as ‘‘out of her mind," and nouns, such as ‘‘fool." DegP is projected either if a predicate is scalar (has a degree argument slot) or to function as a landing site for QR of degree, which will be shown to function as the licensing mechanism for complements of ‘‘seem."},

  abstract = {Movement is a specific property of human languages and one that has at least implicitly been recognized in all linguistic theories. The most recent development posits that movement is forced by morphological requirements (Chomsky 1995). In this paper I will suggest a different approach to movement, suggesting that it is essentially related to the geometry of phrase structure. A weak version of Kayne's 1994 theory of the antisymmetry of syntax, namely 'dynamic antisymmetry' will be introduced. In the strong version, UG only allowed for antisymmetrical configurations, in terms of c-command. Within dynamic antisymmetry, however, symmetrical configurations can be generated, provided that movement makes them antisymmetric before spell-out. In other words, I will suggest that movement is a symmetry-breaking phenomenon, i.e. it is triggered by purely geometrical factors as opposed to morphological ones. Data will range from small clause constructions (both in copular sentences and believe-type verbs) to wh-movement in interrogatives. Italian and English will be the major sources of examples.},

However, a detailed examination of the phonological distributions of segments and tones, combined with a careful analysis of the phonetic realizations of duration and pitch in both citation forms and connected speech, lead to the conclusion that the system is in fact complex and interesting. Based on data from an acoustic experiment, we claim that the tone bearing unit in Thai is the mora, and that previously unexplained restrictions on the distributions of tones in syllables closed by obstruents are the result of a relationship between the glottal feature and low tones. We describe and explain unespected differences int he realization of tones in different phrasal positions in connected speech, and show that there are non-neutralizing contour tone simplifications that take place non-finally at the post-lexical level. Our analysis combines decriptive phonetics and phonology with both representational and constraint-based explanations (incorporating positional faithfulness and stratal OT) to provide a unified account of hte Thai tonal system. Our study supports a view of the grammar in which phonetics and phonology are separate, yet intricately related.},

  volume = {18},
  abstract = {What are Dative Subjects? This paper argues that this term has been applied to two distinct constructions. In one, the surface subject is in the dateive case. In the other, a dative-marked nominal that behaves like a subject in certain respects is not, we claim, a surface subject. Dative nominals of the second type have been analyzed in Relational Grammar as initial subject and final indirect object in the Inversion construction; for the reason we call them I-nominals. Neither adopting nor rejecting the initial-subject analysis of I-nominals, here we argue only that they are not surface subjects. To argue that I-nominals are not surface subjects is not so straightforward, however. Where I-nominals fail to behave like surface subjects, it has been widely assumed that the subject behaviors in question are restricted to nominative subjects. This has made it possible to maintain tha tI nominals are surface subjects despite their nonsubject behaviors, which are attributed to their dative case. To argue against this it is necessary to find a langauge where Inominals' failure to behave like subjects cannot be attributed to their dative case. Here we argue that Russian is such a language. We show that Russian has a true dative-subject construction in which surface subjects are in the dative case. They behave like subjects in every respect. Russian also has I-nominals in the dative case which behave like subjects in only two respects; in other respects they fail to behave like subjects. This failure cannot be attributed to their dative case becasue true dative subjects, also in the dative case, behave like subjects in every respect. We conclude that dative subjects and I-nominals instantiate distinct constructions which must be recognized as such in syntactic typology and syntactic theory. The consequences of this result extend beyond Russian to the analysis of other languages. Where dative-marked nominals behave like subjects in certain respects, it is necessary to determine whether they are I-nominals or dative subjects, based on language-internal evidence. They cannot simply be assumed to be dative subjects, as has often been done. It takes more to be a dative subject than has generally been recognized: it takes language-internal evidence that nominals in question are not I-nominals.},

  volume = {16},
  abstract = {This paper presents evidence from Turkish Raising Constructions that argues that A-chains should potentially terminate in a pronominal element. This is motivated by the possibility of raising from finite clauses in some varieties of Turkish. However, these Raising constructions do exhibit Specified Subject Condition effects, arguing for a theory of the locality of movement that dissociates the prohibition against raising from finite clauses from the prohibition against crossing a specified subject. I argue that Rizzi's (1990) Relativized Minimality approach achieves this separation as a consequence of separate conditions on formal licensing and chian locality. In particular, I propose that Turkish Raising construcitons involve an A-chain whose tail is a silent pronominal (pro). Given that this type of Raising leaves a pronominal copy, neither Principle A of the Binding theory, nor the ECP can be involved (as these apply to only [-pronominal] elements). However, if antecedent government is taken to be a property of chains, as Rizzi proposes, then locality will correctly be enforced in these Copy-Raising cases. This approach is extended to Exceptional Case Marking/Subject to Object Raising constructions, and provides an argument for a Subject to Object Raising analysis. I conclude by briefly comparing the resumptive pronoun strategy in A- and A'-dependencies. From a cross-linguistic perspective, it appears that both allow for a relaxation of ECP effects as well as the mitigation of locality to varying degrees.},

Two specific issues are closely scrutinized: (1) the interaction that took place, in 4th-c. Gallo-Romance, between various types of yod and two general processes of the phonology of the time: diphthongization and voicing, and (2) the left to right alignment shift within Old French diphthongs and triphthongs which gave to the reflex of former velar consonants full vocalic value and the structural properties of a nucleus head. Reranking of universal constraints, as it reflects perceptual enhancements, provides, together with appropriate stages of relexification, the main tool for an analysis of sound change.},

Generic one typically leads to generic sentences whose generalization is obtained from a first-person experience or action or else is meant to be immediately applicable to the relevant agent himself (in particular the addressee). I will argue that generic one involves generic quantification in which the predicate is applied to a given entity `as if' to the relevant agent himself. This is best understood in terms of simulation, a central notion in some recent developments in the philosophy of mind and cognitive science (Simulation Theory): Generic one involves `generic simulation', roughly `putting oneself into the shoes of anyone meeting relevant conditions'. Formally, this means that generic one introduces a complex variable, consisting of an ordinary variable and a `mode of presentation' of the relevant intentional agent, namely the property of being identical to that agent. Generic one, like other pronouns acting as bound variables, may also introduce just an ordinary variable. In both cases, the ordinary variable needs to be bound by a sentential generic operator.},

In previous work on predicative complements and that-clauses I argued that special quantifiers and pronouns introduce entities that would not have occurred in the semantic structure of the sentence without the special quantifier, entities that one would refer to with the corresponding nominalization. Thus something in John thinks something or the same thing in John thinks the same thing as Mary ranges not over propositions, but rather over entities of the sort `John's thought that S' or `the thought that S', without those entities acting as arguments of the think-relation. Despite initial apparent lack of evidence for this view for transitive verbs like need, a closer inspection of a greater range of data gives in fact further support for the `Nominalization Theory' of special quantifiers, once `nominalization' is viewed in a suitably extended and flexible way.},

I also show that BP provides arguments against the MTC when inflected infinitives are considered. Inflected infinitives may be used in BP in partial control structures, which makes it explicit that a singular matrix argument may control a syntactically plural null subject and shows that these two positions cannot be related by movement. Additionally, I show that the MTC makes the wrong predictions when a language with inflected infinitives is considered.},

  title = {Argument {{Structure}} and {{Ditransitive Verbs}} in {{Japanese}}},
  volume = {13},
  abstract = {Ditransitive verbs such as send and give appear in two distinct structures in English, the double object and the to-dative constructions. It is well known that the two differ semantically and syntactically. In some recent works, it is suggested that the semantic differences observed by Bresnan (1978), Oehrle (1976) and others, and the structural properties noted by Barss and Lasnik (1986), Larson (1988), and others, can both be captured by postulating an extra head for the Double Object Construction (DOC, e.g., Marantz (1993), Harley (1995), Pylkk\"anen (2002)). This head, which corresponds to the applicative head in Bantu languages, takes the goal as its specifier and relates it either to the VP that contains the verb and the theme (Marantz (1993)), or directly to the theme (Pylkk\"anen (2002)). The applicative head contributes the meaning distinct to the DOC, and it gives rise to the hierarchical structure noted by Barss and Lasnik. This applicative head is missing in the to-dative so that this construction has an argument structure distinct from the DOC. In this paper, we will look at the corresponding construction(s) in Japanese. Unlike English, Japanese appears to have only one structure, in which the goal is marked with the dative and the theme with the accusative case marking. The goal-theme order is assumed to be the basic order (Hoji (1985), Takano (1998), Yatsushiro (1998, 2003)). The only variation is that the theme can occur before the goal, but this is viewed simply as an instance of optional scrambling. We will give arguments that the difference between English and Japanese is only apparent. With close scrutiny, we find that the two argument structures corresponding to the DOC and the to-dative in English exist in Japanese.},

We take up evidence from Japanese that purports to disprove the locality requirements on floating numeral quantifiers and their associated NP, and we demonstrate that the arguments in fact give evidence for syntactic locality, not against it. Our conclusions suggest that evidence agaist the locality of floating quantifiers given in other langauges should be reexamined.},

For VP-internal word order permutation, the two word orders IO-DO and DO-IO are best viewed as being base-generated instead of as being derived one from the other. For IP-adjunction scrambling, A-scrambling is driven by a Case agreement feature, whereas A'-scrambling is motivated by something like focus.

They involve the functional extension of markers of grammatical dependency from sentence-level syntax into larger discourse and pragmatic domains. Such developments are first illustrated with material from Navajo and Central Alaskan Yup'ik, then surveyed more briefly in several other unrelated languages. In some cases, secondary effects of such changes can reshape basic clause structure. An awareness of these processes can accordingly aid in understandingcertain recurringbut hitherto unexplained arrays of basic morphological and syntactic patterns, exemplified here with cases of homophonous grammatical markers and of ergative/accusative splits. Like developments described by Gildea (1997, 1998) and Evans (2007), they involve the use of dependent clauses as independent sentences, but the processes described here differ from those in both the mechanisms at work and their results.},

First, to distinguish them either a new feature [tense] is needed, or the contrast in voicing (or aspiration) must be increased from two to three. Either way there is a large increase in the number of possible stops in the world's languages, but the expansion lacks support beyond Korean. Second, initial aspirated and tense consonants correlate with a high tone, and lax and voiced consonants correlate with a low tone. The correlation cannot be explained in the standard tonogenesis model (voiceless-high and voiced-low). We argue instead that (a) underlyingly ``tense'' stops are regular voiceless unaspirated stops, and ``lax'' stops are regular voiced stops, (b) there is no compelling evidence for a new distinctive feature, and (c) the consonant-tone correlation is another case of voiceless-high and voiced-low.

Lexicalist alternatives, however, have never been reconciled with the full range of familiar problems and the growing body of known lexical idiosyncracies. We presetn a lexicalist treatment of the French clitic system that treats all 'clitics' as lexical pronominal affixes, whose ordering is templatic in nature. On our account, the order of French pronominal affixes is independent of the general properties of syntactic structures; cliticized words \textendash{} treated as valence-reduced realizations of verbal lexemes \textendash{} enter the syntax fully inflected. The conclusions we reach challenge grammatical architectures that seek to explain the behavior of clitics in terms of functional projections, head movement and/or the Mirror Principles.},

  abstract = {This paper offers an analysis of Tense and Aspect as temporal predicates with complex interpretable content represented as grammatical and abstract semantic features. Building on Klein (1995) and Demirdache and Uribe-Etxebarria (2000), it is proposed that although Tense and Aspect are distinct grammatical categories they both express a relation that can be characterized as (non)-coincidence. Tense expresses (non)-coincidence of the utterance time and the assertion time, while Aspect expresses (non)-coincidence of the assertion time and the situation time. Tense and Aspect are represented by a set of two features: grammatical features [\$$\backslash$pm\$past] and [\$$\backslash$pm\$perf], and the abstract feature [\$$\backslash$pm\$coin]. Thus, they have different grammatical content but the same abstract semantic content. This fine-grained distinction enables us to capture the similarities and differences between the two categories. The interaction between the two types of features together with the syntactic operation of feature agreement accounts for the temporo-aspectual interpretation of verbal morphology, and it also derives the interaction between Tense and Aspect in languages such as Russian.},

As opposed to its rivals, this analysis derives the following characteristics: (i) Resulatative and verb jointly express a single event involving direct causation. (ii) Resultatives form a constituent with the verb. (iii) the head of a resultative complex predicate cannot itself be complex, but the nonhead can. (iv) all thematic information int he head can contribute to the theta-grid of a complex predicate; the nonhead can only contribute the thematic information associated with its external theta-role. (v) The head of a resultative complex predicate expresses an event while the nonhead expresses a resulting state or interrelation. (vi) Resultatives are object-oriented. (vii) Depending ont he thematic properties of the head, the objedct (or derived subject) of a resultative complex predicate must, can, or cannot be interpreted as the internal argument of the verb. (viii) A resultative complex predicate cannot head a doublect object construction.

In this paper we present arguments against this view based on scrambling in Dutch. We discuss a range of implementations of the cartographic approach and show that they are either too weak, in that they cannot generate all the word orders found in Dutch, or too strong, in that they fail to capture restrictions on scrambling. The alternative we present dispenses with discourse-related functional projections and instead relies on mapping rules that associate syntactic representations with representations in information structure. On this view, scrambling operations derive a syntactic configuration that matches the structural description of a mapping rule that could otherwise not apply. We suggest that it is this interface effect that licenses the marked structures created by scrambling.},

Such an analysis must be rejected on the basis of the behavior of PP-complements in predication structures. Instead I propose an analysis in which the verb and the DP contained in a PP-complement are thematically related after abstract incorporation of the preposition. This analysis explains several otherwise mysterious properties of PP-complements. It also provides some evidence for a model of grammar in which thematic relations are not established before LF (contra a GB-style Projection Principle).},

However, since long vowels occupy two positions on this tier, they form a sonority plateau, a configuration that is generally forbidden by basic sonority constraints. To solve this inconsistency, I will propose the concept of segments with inherently falling sonority. In addition, I will consider other candidates for elements with inherently uneven sonority. The intricacies of sonority will be discussed considering German as an example, following the assumption that phonological concepts, despite having a universal core, are characterised by language-specific adjustments.},

  volume = {11},
  abstract = {The Old Japanese modal suffix beshi deserves special attention for at least two reasons. Firstly, it is one of only a few modal markers throughout Japanese language history that have both deontic and epistemic meaning, which is very common in English and other Indo-European languages. Secondly, it is said to be extremely polysemous. There might be no other modal suffix in the history of the Japanese language that has been associated with such a range and variety of meanings. There are also concrete examples of beshi that are given divergent interpretations in grammatical analysis and Modern Japanese translations. The primary goal of this paper is to provide a principled explanation both for the different ``meanings'' of beshi and for divergent interpretations that are due to indeterminacy. It is argued that Old Japanese beshi from a synchronic point of view basically has only a deontic and an epistemic sense, and other ``meanings'' can be explained either in terms of vagueness or in terms of implicature in specific contexts. Conditions are explained under which indeterminacy between the deontic and the epistemic sense arises and compared with the conditions for indeterminacy and deontic-epistemic polysemy to those observed in the history of modals in English and German. Furthermore an account of the diachronic layering behind the syn- chronic meaning range of beshi in Old Japanese is given. It is claimed that the development of the meanings of beshi does not strictly adhere to the ``deontic-to- epistemic'' pattern frequently found on Indo-European languages.},

In a number of languages including Tamil, Russian, Finnish, Icelandic, Malayalm, and Hindi, subjects can receive dative case marking. This phenomenon, labelled 'quirky' or 'lexical' case-marking, is generally accounted for in terms of the association of dative case with an argument bearing a particular thematic role in the lexical entries of individual verbs (Zaenen, Maling \& Thrainsson 1985). Such an account does not account for all the data, neither does it explain why certain thematic roles should get dative case marking. In this paper, I show that hte case-marking patterns in Hindi can be accounted for in a principled manner in terms of the interaction of the aspectual characteristics of the construction, its adicity, and the relative prominence of the arguments of the verb on the Thematic Hierarchy. My account of this phenomenon is formulated within the framework of Role and Reference Grammar (Foley \& Van Valin 1984; Van Valin 1991, 1993).},

We describe our analysis of an Indo-European (IE) dataset (originally assembled by Ringe and Taylor) based on this new model. Our study shows that this new model fits the IE family well and suggests that the early evolution of IE involved only limited contact between distinct lineages. Furthermore, the candidate histories we obtain appear to be consistent with archaeological findings, which suggests that this method may be of practical use. The case at hand provides no opportunity to explore the problem of conflict between network optimization criteria; that problem must be left to future research.},

This article reports the results from an experimental study using a type of complex predicate in Japanese (the V-te V predicate), testing how people process this type of complex ``restructured'' predicate in real time. Because of the properties of the V-te V predicate, it was possible to compare restructured predicates with nonrestructured ones, keeping such factors as event composition, Case licensing, and lexical choice constant. The results of the experiment suggest that the tested restructured predicates involve a single array of predicate-argument association rather than two separate arrays, even though they contain two verbs. The results also revealed that syntactically complex ditransitive predicates are processed with the same ease as lexical ditransitives.},

  volume = {25},
  abstract = {In a broad variety of languages with contrastive vowel length, long vowels are systematically excluded from a domain-final position, and are replaced with short vowels there. This is despite the fact that vowels at the end of a domain (utterance, phrase, word) are generally longer in duration than corresponding nonfinal vowels. We propose that the phonological pattern of final shortening arises diachronically from the effects of final devoicing \textendash{} the breakdown in voicing at the end of an utterance. Partial devoicing of the final vowel makes it difficult to hear the end of the vowel and so favors identification of final vowels as short. If language learners generalize such an identification pattern, they have adopted a final shortening pattern. The claim that partially voiceless final vowels tend to be identified as short is supported by a series of experiments with Finnish speakers. The first two experiments establish that there is both final lengthening and final devoicing in the language. Three further experiments show that Finnish speakers identify the length category of partially voiceless final vowels on the basis of the duration of its voiced portion, so that partial devoicing of a vowel increases the probability of its being identified as short.},

Processes that would create such a sequence are blocked. The problem is how to derive all these different ways of avoiding this configuration from a single principle. It is argued here that Optimality Theory (OT) provides the means to derive the full range of dissimilatory effects from the OCP, through the ranking of the OCP with Faithfulness constraints. Examples of tonal dissimilation in three Bantu langauges are examined: Shona, Rimi, and Kishambaa. The analysis supports the OT interpretation of constraints as violable and ranked.},

To this end, the function that sends propositions to truth values or sets of possible worlds in Thomason (1980) must be replaced by a relation and the meaning postulates governing the behaviour of this relation must be given in the form of a logic program. The resulting system does not only throw light on the properties of sense and their relation to computation, but also shows circular behaviour if some ingredients of the Liar Paradox are added. The connection is natural, as algorithms can be inherently circular and the Liar is explained as expressing one of those. Many ideas in the present paper are closely related to those in Moschovakis (1994), but receive a considerably lighter formalization},

The same pragmatic motivations result in the creation of new free pronouns, and the divergence of free and reduced pronouns with respect to ergative case marking. Examples of languages at different stages of the cycle include Garrwa (one set of free pronouns, with a strong preference for second position); Djambarrpuyngu and Gupapuyngu (two sets of pronouns transparently related in form and in complementary distribution); Ritharrngu, Djinang, and Djinba (two sets of pronouns transparently related in form but in which the reduced pronouns are becoming obligatory); Warlpiri (two sets of pronouns, which diverge in form, and the reduced set is obligatory); and Warumungu (one set of reduced pronouns, indicating how new free pronouns might emerge based on information-packaging principles).

Ham attempts to revise Murray and Vennemanns (M\&V 1983) analysis in which all cases of gemination are motivated by the sonority profile at syllable contact in accordance with Cyllable Contact Law (SCL). Although Ham accepts the relevance of SCL, he claims that two additional constraints are required. I demonstrate, however, that neither constraint can be motivated for the grammar of West Germanic. Indeed, from a diachronic perspective the only function of the additional constraints is to serve as ad hoc diacritics. Accordinaly, while Ham's analysis might be OT-coherent, it fails to translate into a explanatory account of West Germanic gemination. By contrast, I demonstrate that M\&V's original account was correct in identifying hte sonority profile at syllable contact as the primary motivating factor. The paper also ctouches on the issue of rereanking and phonological change. In the absence of reference to general principles, reranking does not 'explain' diachronic' change in any interesting way.},

There are, broadly speaking, three kinds of syntactic analyses of coordination in the literature. In some recent work, coordinate structures are analysed using only clausal coordination and "conjunction reduction" via deletion (E.g. Wilder 1994, Schwarz 1998). In other work, it is argued that conjuncts occupy the specifier and complement of a conjunction phrase (e.b. Munn 1987, Kayne 1994, Johannessen 1996). In parallel structures approaches (Goodall 1987, Moltmann 1993, Wilder 1998), single constituents are often "shared" by two conjuncts. I will argue that coordination asymmetries provide evidence against such accounts and will argue for an analysis in which conjunction is analysed syntactically as phrasal adjunction (Munn 1992, 1993).},

This apper argues that [focus] features enter the grammar in conjunction with [wh] and [tense]. Complex [wh/focus] and [tense/focus] features induce contrastive configurations and crosslinguistic variation. Romanian constructions with preverbal focus are compated with English clefts, and point to a parametric approach: languages display different strategies for overt movement to focus according to their parametric setting for [wh/focus] or [tense/focus]. The analysis of [focus] as syntactically dependent on [wh]/[tense] provides a uniformtreatment for important variation in focus constructions (e.g. preposing through clitic doubling chains versus clefting) and in interrogative clauses (e.g. presence versus absence of V2 effects in embedded interrogatives).},

The network reanalysis was based solely on formal cues (word endings and analogy with other words) and on frequency. The results are in accordance with the historical data, and certain errors in simulations are also amenable to principled explanations. Simulations improve dramatically when the networks incorporate information about the Celtic substrate which presumably interfered with gender assignment in Gallo- Romance. This finding has a bearing on issues of gender assignment and processing in bilinguals. Simulations also improve with the introduction of more elaborate recurrent networks, which suggests implications for future connectionist modeling. In particular, the results could be applied to the modeling of gender change in other Romance languages and to the modeling of comparative Romance gender systems. The method proposed here would be advantageous for such simulations since it allows the modeler to take into account a rich variety of facts reflecting actual linguistic history.},

  volume = {1},
  abstract = {This paper presents a structural account of imperative clauses where the theoretical cornerstones are the Minimalist Program of Chomsky (1995) and the analysis of the C-domain in Rizzi (1995). According to Rizzi, the C-domain has at least two parts, the outward facing ForceP, a sentence type projection where information of the type of the clause is represented, and an inward facing part, FinP, related to tense and mood. We argue in this paper that the main difference between imperative clauses and other sentence types is the lack of FinP and hence finiteness in imperative clauses; having no FinP, imperative clauses also lack MoodP and TP. The imperative clause is thus less articulated compared with the declarative and interrogative clauses. From the lack of FinP follow the three most salient properties of imperative clauses: the morphologically meagre form of the verb, the impossibility of embedding imperative clauses, and the lack of a prototypical subject. The last mentioned fact has the consequence that an imperative clause can never be used to refer to the addressee in the same way as a declarative and interrogative clause can: imperative clauses can only be used to talk TO the addressee, not ABOUT him or her. We support our theoretical approach by empirical evidence drawn mainly from German, English, and Mainland Scandinavian.},

However, there is a large amount of variation in stress assignment (e.g. silk tie, Madison Avenue, singer-songwriter) whose significance and sources are largely unaccounted for in the literature. This article presents a study in which three kinds of factors held to play a role in compound stress assignment are tested: argument structure, lexicalization, and semantics. The analysis of 4,353 noun-noun compounds extracted from the Boston University Radio Speech Corpus shows that there is indeed a considerable amount of variation in stress assignment. Overall, semantics turns out to have the strongest effect on compound stress assignment, whereas an approach relying on argument structure is much less successful in predicting compound stress. The article presents for the first time large-scale empirical evidence for the assumption that lexicalization has an effect on compound stress assignment. The article also makes a methodological contribution to the debate in showing that (and how) corpus-based studies using acoustic measurements can shed new light on the issue of variable compound stress.},

  abstract = {The article deals with the phonological behaviour of two evaluative suffixes in casual spoken French, namely -ingue and -if. Like many suffixes of this kind, these have variant forms with an initial consonant. My claim is that these initial consonants are epenthetic ones. A study of the environments where these two types of variant are found shows that, setting aside cases where the suffix follows a consonantal cluster, these final variants are in complementary distribution. The rule is that the -ingue variant follows a voiced adn oral coronal consonant and that the if variant is preceded by a voiced or unvoiced oral coronal consonant which is neither /d/ nor /l/. This in fact explains why, whereas these suffixes normally replace the final rhyme of the polysyllabic words to which they attach, we observe cases of concatenation and truncations extending further than a thyme. The cononant-initial variants, which occur when the base word does not contain an appropriate consonant, are themselves in complementary distribution. Finally, we observe that initial consonants of consonant-initial variants form a subset of the consonants which the vowel-initial variants allow in front of them. These facts argue for the existence of output constraints which exclude the occurrence of -ingue and -if in a syllable whose onset does not belong to the above-mentioned consonant classes: the epenthesis has the effect of satisfying these constraints when the base word does not contain an appropriate consonant, and when the presence of a consonant cluster does not preclude this insertion.},

There is a consensus that in early grammar, children omit object clitics in contexs where an adult would not. Several analyses have been put forth, among which, one proposing a close link between the omission of object clitics and the presence of past participle agreement. In this short article we address this hypothesis by examining the acquisition of past participle agreement through two sentence-preference tasks administered to children (3- to 5-year olds divided into three age groups) and adults from the Montr\'eal area. The results of the experiments show that past participle agreement is a marginal feature in early grammar and therefore too weak to be considered as a controlling the realization of the direct object clitics in child production. Children and adults display different behavior with respect to past participle agreement (weak and optional) versus subject-verb agreement (consistently strong and obligatory). This result points toward an analysis of past participle agreement in terms of language-specific optional verb movement.},

Third, the paper introduces new observations about the distribution of clausal gerunds and argues that the complex alternations and restrictions on their distribution results from the interaction between Case and Agreement valuation, the limited possibility of A-movement out of a clausal gerund, and convergence considerations resulting from the existence of distinct numerations},

  abstract = {In this paper it is argued that Catalan sequences of a (semi-) modal verb and an infinitive, which are traditionally known as $\backslash$sc restructuring constructions, should be analyzed as base-gegnerated monosentential complexes. It is claimed that in such comlexes the infinitive verb, not the modal or the semi-modal, is the primary predicate determining the argument structure of the sentnece adn its basic syntactic configuration. Modals with the epistemic reading are analyzed as constituents of INFL, whereas root modals and semi-modals are analyzed as VP adjuncts. Evidence for this analysis is provided by a number of independent phenomena, including the distribution of $\backslash$emphen/ne cliticization of the subject, locality conditions on srgument chain formation, interpretation of adjacent modals, restrictions on infinitive and gerund markers, interpretation of plural null pronominals, the distribution of auxiliaries, and clitic climbing.},

  volume = {17},
  abstract = {This paper presents a constraint-based analysis of a process that in Traditional New Mexico Spanish (TNMS) generates a syllabic consonant from a sonorant consonant + stressed high vowel combination. It is argued that although vowels are more suitable than consonants to function as prosodic heads, consonants may sometimes be favored over vowels in the role of foot and syllable head. This situation arises when a positional markedness constraint barring the marked value on the place-of-articulation scale (e.g., Dorsal) from the position of foot DTE becomes active. Contrary to previous approaches that assume that vowel deletion is a condition for the syllabization of the consonant, it is argued that the vowel that disappears in the process of syllabizing a consonant is not deleted but either absorbed by that consonant or assimilated to it. It is also demonstrated that syllabic consonants are subject to two universal alignment constraints that govern their distribution by forcing them to be coarticulated with another consonant. Although languages may vary as to whether the syllabic consonant is coarticulated with a preceding or with a following consonant, there are no languages where syllabic consonants appear between two vowels or between a vowel and a pause precisely because in such environments there is not an adjacent consonant available for coarticulation. The condition that the syllabic consonants of TNMS be coarticulated not with a preceding, but with a following consonant, is the reason why they do not occur in prevocalic or prepausal position.},

Such constructions hold even greater interest for the question of the relation between grammatical knowledge and real-time language processing. This article presents results from two experiments on parasitic-gap constructions in English in which the parasitic gap appears inside a subject island, before the licensing gap. An off-line studyconfirms that parasitic gaps are acceptable when theyoccur inside the infinitival complement of a subject NP, but not when they occur inside a finite relative clause. An on-line self-paced reading studyusing a plausibility manipulation technique shows that incremental positing of gaps inside islands occurs in just those environments where parasitic gaps are acceptable. The fact that parasitic gaps are constructed incrementallyin language processing presents a challenge for attempts to explain subject islands as epiphenomena of constraints on language processing and also helps to resolve apparent conflicts in previous studies of the role of island constraints in parsing.*},

  abstract = {The 1990s witnessed a major expansion in research on children's morphosyntactic development, due largely to the availability of computer-searchable corpora of spontaneous speech in the CHILDES database. This led to a rapid emergence of parallel findings in different languages, with much attention devoted to the widely attested difficulties in inflectional morphology in the speech of two- year-olds. First written in 1995, and framed within the terms of contemporary syntactic theories, this article argues that cross-linguistic differences in the distribution of children's morphosyntactic errors provide important clues to the source of the errors, in particular whether they are morphological or syntactic in origin. The article takes as its starting point some striking previous findings that children's verb inflection errors are systematically correlated, on a sentence-by-sentence basis, with errors in the use of overt subjects, and with the use of syntactically complex constructions such as wh-questions. The article shows that these correlations are found in some languages but not in others, and argues that these differences are predictable, based on the verb movement and case licensing properties of individual languages. The article argues that children's errors reflect a combination of grammatical and speech production deficits.},

We attribute misplaced clitics to children's incomplete knowledge concerning properties of the inflectional (Infl) particles, which interact in crucial ways with finite V(erb) movement to M(ood). We claim that children perceive Infl particles as phrasal specifiers or adjuncts, unable to check the V-features of M, hence perform V-to-M movement even in their presence, and clitics emerge in (nonadult) postverbal position, giving the impression that they have been misplaced. We point out that functional heads seem to be perceived as phrasal in other early languages and possibly also in domains other than Infl, and we explain why clitics are not found misplaced in standard Greek and standard Romance, with the exception of Portuguese. Finally, the absence of qualitative differences between the early populations and populations with SLI we studied corroborates with views that consider SLI a language delay, but the degree to which quantitative differences were attested raises questions.},

This approach provides a descriptively adequate account of key properties of coordination, including the distribution of grammatical funcitons across all conjuncts, the ability to coordinate unlike categories under certain syntactic conditions, and the non-distribution of lexical properties such as tense and number. Coordination is subject to the condition that items can be conjoined if and only if they satisfy the condition of functional equivalence. This condition does not have to be stipulated; it follows as an axiom from the general principles of functional application to sets. Since coordination is not a headed construction, there is not percolation path for features from individual categories within a coordinate structure to the node dominating the coordination. therefore lexical properties will not be shared across the coordination as a whole. The lack of distributivity allows individual conjuncts to differ in terms of lexical properties. In particular, it is expected, rather than exceptional, that coordinated NPs may differ in number, person, case and gender. The proposed account also predicts a high level of idiosyncrasy and variability with respect to 'agreement' between the subject NP and the verb and/or predicate complement.},

These clash in infinitival contexts, which explains the gap. The explanation is language-internal in that it relies on no putatively universal principles. At the same time, each type of device posited is needed independently in the grammars of other languages. Our result bears on the issue of what languageparticular properties expletives may have, on the issue of whether silent expletives exist, and on the more general theoretical issue of whether clauses are required to have subjects universally.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this paper s to propose a satisfying model-theoretic account of the notions of singularity, collective plurality, and distributive plurality expressed by both the nouns and the verbs of Papgo according to Mathiot (1983). The approach will be algebraic in the sense of Link (1983). Informally, our proposal is that while English has only one form of plurality, Papago has two: one based on identity and the other on equivalence. The identity-based plural is one that Papgo shares with English and other Indo-European langauges; the equivalence-based plural, on the other hand, is characteristic of Papgo and other Native American languages. The extreme elaboration of the notion of multiplicity expressed in Papgo follows from this proposal, given sufficiently rich models and independently motivated principles governing hte semantics of roots (Wackernagel 1920; Ojeda 1993; Eschenbach 1993), markedness (Jakobson 1957), and verbs (Davidson 1967; Parsons 1990).},

This construction is known to receive at last two distinct interpretations: on-going process interpretations analogous to the English progressive and so-called resultative interpretations. The latter are sub-classified by some researchers into concrete result state readings and experiential state readings. Based upon the distributional properties of adverbials, we suggest that progressive interpretations of DURATIVE VERBS and concrete result state interpretations of INSTANTANEOUS VERBS should be grouped together, as opposed to experiential readings of DURATIVE or INSTANTANEOUS VERBS. To account for the distinction between these two types of interpretation, the proposed system analyzes the -te iru form into the morpheme -te, which is claimed to bear a perfect feature, and the aspectual auxiliary iru. Our proposal for the aspectual auxiliary iru is an extension of Landman's (1992) proposal and offers a unified account of the multiple interpretations of -te iru on the basis of a new analysis of INSTANTANEOUS VERBS.},

  volume = {27},
  abstract = {This article discusses what may be referred to as ``adjectival relatives${'''}$'in Japanese and related constructions in other languages (such asadjectival passives in English). The most intriguing characteristicof this construction is that the verb contained in it occurs in the pasttense form, but its primary role is to describe a state that obtains atthe local evaluation time, rather than the past event that producedthis state. In fact, in some cases, the putative event that presumablyproduced the target state is non-existent, and the entire constructionreceives a purely stative interpretation. In other words, it is possiblefor an adjectival relative to describe a target state without having itstriggering event. The proposal I put forth in the article states that whatI refer to as an adjectival relative does not have a clausal structure.It rather has a verbal projection (technically a Tense Phrase, or TP). Mod(the modifier head) then combined with TP to yield a MP (modifierphrase), which denotes a property of states that appear to have resultedfrom an event the verb describes. In order to reach this conclusion, I adopttwo additional ideas: (i) Kratzer''s (1996) idea that the so-called externalargument of a verb is not really its argument at all; (ii) direct causationdoes not have to be overtly represented in natural language syntax (Bittner1999). Having incorporated these two ideas, the proposal explains therelation between the state that the adjectival relative describes and theputative event as a modal one, thereby accounting for the non-existenceof putative past events in some examples.},

It is argued that the relevant sentences do not involve it. This, together with a particular assumption about the properties of so-called D-pronouns n Dutch accounts for all relevant facts in a manner which is compatible with Higgins's Generalization. Since the validity of Higgins's Generalization for other sentential complements has been established already, it is concluded that it is fully valid for Dutch. It is argued that this generalization can be derived from an analysis of topicalization of sentences as a special case of contrastive dislocation but not from (two varieties of) a topicalization analysis. A further consequence is that infinitival complements in Dutch cannot be analyzed as subjectless VPs but contain further structure above the VP, and the analysis imposes specific requirements on the nature of certain rules for interpreting pronouns.},

Building on Miyagawa's (1993) analysis, the present paper argues that a genitive phrase raises out of a prenominal gapless clause in either overt or covert syntax. This claim is crucially based on Lasnik's (1999a) analysiso fo Exceptional Case Marking constructions in English, according to which the ECM subject raises into a higher clause either overtly or covertly. It is also demonstrated that when a genitive subject originates in a relative clause, its raising is limited to covert syntax. This non-uniform behavior of the genitive subject is argued to follow from a particular implementation of Attract F.},

The main argument for this hypothesis comes from the transitivity restriction imposed on the genitive-subject construction in this language.

This hypothesis also derives the well-known ban on multiple occurrences of accusative phrases in the Japanese causative construction. The paper also makes several theoretical points. For instance, the EPP checking (in the traditional sense) is contingent on an independent Agree relation such as Case checking. Also, calculation of equidistance is confined to a very local domain of a syntactic derivation.},

Assuming Nunes's (1995, 1998) analysis of parasitic gaps in terms of sideward movement, we argue that standard parasitic gap constructions do not exhibit CED effects because K manages to move to a different derivaitonal workspace before the structure containing it is spelled out. Finally, we provide an account of the cases where parasitic gap constructions appear to show CED effects by relying on cyclic access to the numeration, along the lines proposed by Chomsky (1998).},

The crucial aspect of this alternative model is that it permits constrained instances of sidward movement, whereby a given constituent "moves" from a syntactic object K to an indpendent syntactic object L. This version of the copy theory of movement (a) provides an explanation for why (some) traces must be deleted in teh phonological component, (b) provides a cylcic analysis for standard instances of noncyclic movement, and (c) accounts for the main properties of parasitic gap and across-the-board extraction constructions.},

This paper addresses exactly how the conflicting demands of syntactic ordering and purely morphological ordering are mediated, with data from Nunggubuyu (Australia, documented by Heath (1980, 1982, 1984)). Two mechanisms are proposed. First, a pre-Spell-Out deletion of features by means of Impoverishment rules (Bonet 1991, 1995) bleeds the insertion of certain clitics. Impoverishment rules also feed and bleed one another, giving rise to complex surface patterns. Second, clitics which survive Impoverishment must move in Morphology from their abstract (syntactic) position to conform with surface ordering restrictions. Heath formalized these movements as Affix Hopping transformations, but this paper shows that Hopping always local, and can thus be modelled as an instance Morphological Merger (Marantz 1988). Where clitic sequences cannot be properly reordered by local movements, clitic deletion applies as a Last Resort to allow PF convergence. The proposed locality restriction explains a battery of seemingly unrelated clitic deletions in a principled way.},

I argue that faithfulness to an underlying suffix value ranks higher than faithfulness to an underlying root value. This argument is based on the existence of a set of invariant [+ATR] and a set of invarieant [-ATR] suffixes. These suffixes fail to agree with a preceding root in tongue root position and instead impose their tongue root specification on any vowel that precedes them, subject to the markedness constraints *HI/RTR and *LO/ATR. The invariant suffixes of Turkana are therefore characterized by two of the properties Beckman (1997) lists as a phonological process. I conclude that suffix position must be recognized as linguistically salient in Turkana and sibmit that root faithfulness does not outrank affix faithfulness universally, as suggested by McCarthy and Prince (1995).},

An alternative proposal by Crain, Ni \& Conway (1994) maintains that children misassign only to the VP, yielding The cat is only holding a flag. The findings of experimental studies with two typologically distinct languages, English and Mandarin Chinese, support Crain et al.'s (1994) analysis. We propose, further, that children pass through a stage at which only is analyzed as a sentential adverb taking scope over both the subject NP and the VP.

  title = {Nominal {{Tense}} in {{Crosslinguistic Perspective}}},
  volume = {80},
  abstract = {It is a general assumption in linguistic theory that the categories of tense, aspect, and mood (TAM) are inflectional categories of verbal classes only. In a number of languages around the world, however, nominals and other NP constituents are also inflected for these categories. In this article we provide a comprehensive survey of tense/aspect/mood marking on NP constituents across the world's languages. Two distinct types are identified: propositional nominal TAM, whereby the nominal carries TAM information relevant to the whole proposition, and independent nominal TAM, in which the TAM information encoded on the nominal is relevant only to the NP on which it is marked \textendash{} independent of the TAM of the clause as a whole. We illustrate these different types and their various properties using data from a wide range of languages showing that, while certainly unusual, the phenomenon of nominal tense/aspect/mood marking is far less marginal than is standardly assumed. Nominal TAM inflection must be accpeted as a real possibility in universal grammatical structure, having significant implications for many aspects of linguistic theory.},

  volume = {22},
  abstract = {It is generally held that clausal temporal, aspectual and modal featuers, when encoded morphologically, are expressed by or on clasal heads. However nominals and modifiers within NP can also be inflected for tense, aspect and modal features interpreted with respect to the clausal predication rather than with respect to the nominal argument itself. Such nominals (and dependents within NP) therefore contribute syntactic tense, aspect and mood features to the clause, but do not themselves have syntactically active TAM features. Building on previous work we show how a simple account of this phenomenon can be given in the lexicalist, constraint-based theory of LFG. In particular, the use of inside-out funciton application in LFG permits us to capture direclty the role of nominal morphology in defining clausal TAM properties without recourse to derivational or feature passing mechanisms.},

However, tamyen-antecedents do not always express such an irrealis speaker atti- tude. This paper analyses the difference between myen and tamyen in terms of the modes of language use, i.e., descriptive and metarepresentational uses. It introduces the concept of interpretive use as defined and used in relevance theory and suggests that the ta in tamyen functions as an interpretive use marker. The presence of this interpretive use marker is responsible for the different felicities between myen- and tamyen-conditionals. Since a tamyen-antecedent is a metarepresentation of another representation, it is not used to describe a state of affairs in the content domain. This explains why deictic, generic, and temporal conditionals are more often used with myen, and given conditionals (i.e., conditionals whose antecedents are contextually given) with tamyen.},

The purpose of this article is to argue that this corss-linguistic difference is due to the difference in syntactic categories. English personal pronouns are determiners (Postal 1969), exemplifying what will be referred to as D-Pronouns, and can be construed as bound variables, whereas Japanese personal pronouns are nouns, exemplifying what will be referred to as N-Pronouns, and cannot be so construed. I argue that this follows from a general condition on binding that applies only to functional items, and not to lexical ones. I provide empirical and conceptual support for this hypothesis on the basis of the behavior of such elements as articles, determiners, and demonstrative pronouns as well as that of personal pronouns.},

We exploit the insight that while language learning takes place at the individual level, language change is more properly regarded as an ensemble property that takes place at the level of populations of language learners. We show by analytical and computer simulation methods that language learning can be regarded as the driving force behind a dynamical systems account of language change. We apply this model to the specific case of historical change from Classical Portuguese to European Portuguese, demonstrating how a particular language learning model coupled with data on the differences between Classical and European Portuguese leads to specific predictions for possible language-change envelopes. The main investigative message of this paper is to show how this methodology can be applied to a specific case, that of ortuguese. The main moral underscores the individual/population difference; we show that simply because an individual will choose a particular grammar does not mean that all other grammars will be eliminated.},

This type of copula is distinct from another type of copula, which is a dummy and projects VP. The differences between the two types of adjectives are captured at the level of morphology, by utilizing the principles of Distributed Morphology (Halle and Marantz, 1993), which places morphology between the syntax and PF.},

Such a pairing incorrectly locates the form-function interplay in the mental grammar itself, rather than seeing the response of form to function as emerging from language use and acquisition. Furthermore, FOT seems incompatible with the standard OT assumption that constraints are universal. Finally, two of the functionally-motivated hierarchies that are central to FOT theorizing, the thematic and relational hierarchies, are highly problematic, while incorporating the others into an FOT analysis leads to otherwise unnecessary complexity.},

In this article I defend the classical position, and provide evidence from a number of sources that speakers mentally represent full grammatical structure, however fragmentary their utterances might be. The article also questions the relevance of most corpus-based frequency and probability studies to models of individual grammatical competence.

The analysis developed in this paper makes use of u-features instead of referential indices; specifically, referentiality is said to be encoded by means of u-feature values, which are unavailable until D is merged. Finally, it is argued that the differences between languages without overt articles (e.g., Russian) and those with overt articles (e.g., Norwegian) are purely morphological rather than syntactic; both types of languages are shown to have both DPs and Small Nominals.},

  volume = {80},
  abstract = {Some, but not all, languages with fixed stress exhibit lexical exceptions to their stress rule. Under the assumption that lexical exceptions can occur in a langauge only if its native speakers can perceive stress contrasts. I argue that the presence of these exceptions depends on the age at which infants discover the stress rule of their language. If the stress regularity is easy to infer from the surface speech stream, then it will be acquired very early, and stress will not be encoded in teh phonological representation of words in the mental lexicon: as a consequence, stress contrasts are not well perceived by adult speakers and lexical exceptions are excluded. If, by contrast, the regularity is difficult to infer, then it will be acquired relatively late, after the format of the phonological encoding of words has been fixed. That is, stress will be redundantly encoded in the mental lexicon, and lexical exceptions can thus be perceived adn stored by adult speakers. A typological survey concerning the occurrence of exceptions in languages with fixed stress supports this proposal. A comparison with a metrical approach to exceptional stress is made, leading to a proposal about the division of labor between psycholinguistcs and theoretical phonology.},

It is argued that Baker's (1996a,b) approaches are essentially correct in their analysis of 'how' various nonconfigurational languages establish relationships between overt elements, but that they fail to capture the 'why' of nonconfigurationality. This source, it is argued, is a restriction on what positions in the clause are able to host encyclopedic information (as opposed to formal features, which are always permitted in core predicate and argument positions). These restricitons drive a language to employ various of the mechanisms proposed by Baker in his work. This analysis is then extended to a variety of language types. Finally, a continuum of (non)configurational types is established among some Australian languages.},

  volume = {23},
  abstract = {As in other Philippine-type languages, clauses in Malagasy contain a structurally and referentially prominent DP constituent, the trigger, whose grammatical function is indicated by voice morphology on the verb. The trigger shares functional properties with both subjects and topics in other languages. In the Principles and Parameters literature, most researchers identify the trigger as a structural subject, located in the position where nominative case is checked. In this paper, I present evidence that the trigger occupies an A'-position comparable to that of topics in verb-second languages such as Icelandic. I also consider some of the consequences of this analysis: I suggest that voice morphology in Malagasy, rather than marking relation-changing operations like passive, (indirectly) encodes the abstract case features of the A'-chain linked to the trigger, making it akin to Wh-Agreement in Chamorro. In addition, I argue for a non-traditional treatment of the well-known A'-extraction restricitons in Malagasy, usually captured by means of language-specific constraint prohibiting extraction of non-subjects. Treating the trigger as a topic rather than a subject, I propose that wh-movement competes with topicalization for the same A'-position (as in verb-second langauges), rendering the two operations mutually exclusive within a clause.},

Given Johnson's (1994, 1996) analysis of verb gapping as ATB movement of the verb to a functional category, the apparent lack of verb gapping in Chinese seems to fit in nicely with another idea prevalent in Chinese linguistics viz., that verb movement is confined to the VP-shell (cf. Huang, 1992, 1994; Tsai, 1994). The present article argues against these claims and provides evidence for the existence of verb gapping \textendash{} though restricted \textendash{} in Chinese. Furthermore, it shows that Johnson's ATB movement analysis of gapping can be successfully applied to Chinese as well which leads to the typologically important result that the verb in Chinese can \textendash{}under particular circumstances \textendash{} leave the VP and raise to a functional category in overt syntax.},

Moreover, it is shown that the same inversion occurs in equative and specificational sentences in Malagasy, which suggests that these types of sentences share the same syntactic structure.

The sentences with only were ambiguous between an analysis with contrastive focus assigned to the verb phrase (VP) and one with contrastive focus assigned to the direct object. The results indicate that both children and adults interpreted sentences with only as excluding the possibility of events that formed a contrast with VP constituents. Children also appeared to interpret sentences without only as excluding the possibility of these events despite the absence of grammatical cues that might indicate contrastive focus. We consider these results in relation to a processing account of focus interpretation (Crain, Ni, and Conway (1994)).},

More recent proposals have claimed that most does not generate a scalar implicature but is semantically both lower and upper bounded (Ariel (2004; in press)). In this article, we investigate the interpretation of most experimentally to evaluate these competing semantic and pragmatic accounts. We focus on a comparison of most and half because, on the classical view, half and other exact determiners should admit bilateral interpretations more readily than the upward-oriented most (Horn (in press)); however, no such difference should exist if most is both lower and upper bounded. We find that (i) in nonbiasing contexts, adults are more likely to treat most as being compatible with all than half ; (ii) a similar asymmetry emerges in children's interpretations of the two determiners; and (iii) adults adjust the higher boundary of the interpretation of most according to context-driven expectations. Taken together, these results support the classical, lower bounded, semantic analysis of most over recent revisions.

  abstract = {Historical accounts of the phenomenon of cliticization have previously documented only the loss of second-position clitics. This paper argues that the history of Bulgarian offers evidence for the rise of a second-position clitic system. It is demonstrated that the second-position clitics of Old Bulgarian were not directly inherited from Indo-European, but emerged from a system of post-verbal clitics. The findings provide evidence against the position that independent historical laws govern `natural' directions of langauge change. In particular, they challenge the belief in the uniform tendency for clitics to develop into inflectional affixes. Instead, the findings suggest that language change reflects competition between grammatical options, which instantiate principles and parameters of UG based on the properties of the learning algorithm and the nature of the linguistic input, and which are not intrinically ranked. An analysis of the historical change that led to the development of second-position clitics in Old Bulgarian is proposed that implicates a switch in the parameter of headedness of TP. Clitics in both the old and new grammars are attracted by T. A change in the position of T relative to its complement triggers the reanalysis of clitics from pronominals forming a complex head with V to pronominals moving to the left edge of TP. The non-branching status of clitics makes them category-ambiguous (D/DP), which allows them to merge in the syntactic structure as either heads or maximal projections. The paper also traces the eventual loss of the second-position clitic system in Bulgarian and argues that changes in the grammar of phrasal movement, specifically the loss of topicalization to Spec,TP, trigger the syntactic reanalysis of clitics from arguemtns moved and adjoined to TP, into adjuncts to functional heads in the extended projection of V, resulting in the modern pre-verbal clitic system.},

  volume = {78},
  abstract = {This article argues for a particular understanding of feature class behavior\textemdash{}the recurrent patterning together of certain phonological features, such as place of articulation and laryngeal features. The proposals build on the well-known work of feature geometry in assuming the importance of feature classes in phonology, but differ in that features of a class are targeted directly and individually by constraints (or rules), even when a feature class such as Place is mentioned. Further, constraints mentioning feature classes are gradiently violable. Evidence for this view of feature classes comes from two sources. First, assimilation involving feature classes is sometimes only partially successful; an adequate understanding of such cases requires the proposed view of feature classes. Second, there are broad categories of feature class generalization that require it, including dissimilatory effects usually handled by the obligatory contour principle. Overall, the proposals broaden the explanatory potential of the feature class idea due to feature geometry. At a more general level, the results here suggest that linguistic representations sometimes need to be reconsidered in the context of optimality theory (Prince \& Smolensky 1993), since they can effectively function as inviolable constraints and so hinder our understanding of the more subtle kind of phenomena revealed by analyses employing gradiently violable constraints.},

  abstract = {There is a well-known rule of Russian whereby /i/ is said to be realized as [i] after non-palatalized consonants. Somewhat less well known is another allpphonic rule of Russian whereby only [i], and not [-i], can follow velars within a morphological word. This latter rule came about due to a sound change in East Slavic called post-vlar fronting here: k-i $>$ kji (and similarly for the other velars). This paper examines this sound change in depth, and argues that it can be adequately explained only by appeal to the funcitonal notions of perceptual distinctiveness of contrast and neutralization avoidance. Further, these notions crucially require a systemic approach to phonology, in which the wellformedness of any form must be evaluated with reference to the larger system of contrasts it enters into. These notions are formalized in a modified version of Dispersion Theory (Flemming 1995a), a systemic theory that incorporates these functional notions into Optimality Theory (Prince and Smolensky 1993).},

The alternative analysis is based on establishing a parametric distinction relating to categorial identity of the relative clause such that it is a CP in some languages and a DP in others. The first type is found in languages where the relative complementizer is the same as teh normal complementizer of sentential complementation (e.g., Hebrew). The second type is found in languages where the relative complementizer is a determiner (e.g., Amharic and Arabic). this difference is shown to have crucial implications for the structure and derivation of N-initial and N-final relatives, as well as for some relevant typological generalizations, including a generalization relating to the phenomenon of (relative) clause nominalization.},

It argues that syntactic ergativity arises when the relevant operation is sensitive to (abstract) Case. Since not all syntactic operations are sensitive to Case, it is expected that some morphologically ergative languages do not show syntactic ergativity, or even demonstrate syntactic split ergativity. As an illustration, two types of coordination reduction in Tongan (Polynesian) are examined: pea-coordination showing an ergative/absolutive pattern and mo-coordination showing a nominative/accusative pattern. It is argued that DP ellipsis in pea-coordination is a Case-sensitive operation, i.e., PF deletion based on featural identity, whereas mo-coordination involves a null pronoun and LF copying, which is based on positional identity, regardless of Case.},

  abstract = {In past studies of the Korean and Japanese morphological passives (KMP and JMP, respectively), emphasis has been put on their similarities. To explain their differences (e.g., only the JMP has a subvariety called indirect passive), several authors have attempted to capture the relation between the KMP and JMP on a continuous scale, where the KMP is more ``restricted'' than the JMP. The ``continuity'' approach to the KMP/JMP is, however, hard to maintain for two reasons. First, under the continuity hypothesis it is hard to explain the link between the KMP/JMP and their related constructions, i.e., the causative for the former and the spontaneous, potential, and honorific for the latter. Second, the continuity hypothesis cannot explain why the two constructions invoke an adversity implicature under different conditions. I argue that the KMP and JMP have substantially different core syntax/semantics and examine the sources of adversity implicatures associated with them. The KMP is semantically monostratal and is associated with a construction-specific adversative meaning (conventional implicature). By contrast, the JMP encodes the triadic relation of ``lack of control'' among an agent, an undergoer, and an event; the adversative meaning of the indirect passive is derived as a conversational implicature.},

After the validity of the PR in English and German is established, the discussion examines the extent to which constituency grammar can explain the parallelism effect. The argument is made that constituency grammar is indeed in a position to express the PR, although doing so requires that certain non-standard assumptions about constituency structures are adopted. Moreover, it is emphasized that the dependency-based approach is preferable due to its paucity of structure.},

The account builds on the insight that the syntax of comparatives is a combination of coordination and subordination. At times a than-expression is coordinate to a string that immediately precedes it, and at other times, it is subordinate to it. Six key observations are the pillars of the account. These observations accomplish three goals: 1) They determine when comparative coordination obtains, as opposed to comparative subordination; 2) they predict the form that a particular than-expression can assume (e.g. phrasal, clausal); and most importantly, 3) they predict to a large extent the distribution of than-expressions. The key concept is functional equivalence. One can predict the distribution of many than-expressions by acknowledging where they can appear with respect to their functional equivalents. The theory-neutral account remains entirely in surface syntax.},

The aim of this paper is twofold. First, we argue that the scope of the PCC is considerably broader than assumed in previous work, and that neither its formulation in terms of person (1st/2nd vs. 3rd)-case (accusative vs. dative) restrictions nor its morphological nature are part of the right descriptive generalization.We present evidence (i) that the PCC is triggered by the presence of an animacy feature in the object's agreement set; (ii) that it is not case dependent, also showing up in languages that lack dative case; and (iii) that it is not morphologically bound. Second, we argue that the PCC, even if it is modified accordingly, still puts together two different properties of the agreement system that should be set apart: (i) a cross-linguistic sensitivity of object agreement to animacy and (ii) a similarly widespread restriction on multiple object agreement observed crosslinguistically. These properties lead us to propose a new generalization, the Object Agreement Constraint (OAC): if the verbal complex encodes object agreement, no other argument can be licensed through verbal agreement.},

We argue that inversion involves IP movement to an exploded CP as Kayne and Pollock (2001). The IP that moves to the exploded CP contains preverbal weak pronominals in Caribbean Spanish. Non Caribbean Spanish lacks these weak pronominals and therefore subjects are either in situ (postverbal) or have been topicalized to the CP, previous movement of the whole IP.},

It has been generally assumed that the second order is generated by the adjunction of the subject to the right (Rizzi 1982, Torrego 1984, and Su\~ner 1994). This paper explores an alternative to this traditional view in which this order is gneerated by the scrambling of the objects to the left. Empirical support in favor of this hypothesis comes from certain syntactic asymmetries between VSO and VOS. Some of these asymmetries reflect the fact that the object c-commands the subject in teh VOS order but not in the VSO order. In other cases, the asymmetries show that certain types of objects cannot move to the left to produce the VOS order. This is the result predicted by the constrained nature of scrambling. Specifically, there is a parallel between these alternations in Spanish and the same ones described in scrambling langauges (e.b., German or Korean) with SOV and OSV alternations. Finally, this hypothesis supports the line of research put forward by Kayne (1994) for word order in UG, according to which right adjunction is not possible.},

We review documented language games and slips of the tongue that lead to the same conclusion. We also discuss evidence for the morphemic status of templates from aphasic erros, language games, and slips of the tongue. We conclude that the available external evidence is best accounted for within a morpheme-based theory of morphology that forms words by combining roots and templates.},

Roughly put, multiplicity of events is encoded syntactically, in fact iconically, by an increased number of conjunction markers. I argue that the effect eventually follows from Economy of Pronunciation, a principle independently needed in the grammar. These event considerations are argued to be encoded in the structural representation of coordination.},

As far as I can see, there can be three types of counterexamples to Progovac: (i) noncorrelative constructions necessarily involving multiple-event interpretations (with no independent factor excluding single-event interpretations); (11) correlative coordination involving single-event interpretations; and (iii) pairs in which noncorrelative coordination permits multiple-event interpretation but the correlative couterparts only have single-event interpretation. The alleged counterexamples offered in Tsohatzidis are only of types (i) and (ii). On closer inspection, it turns out that the alleged type (i) counterexamples are not true counterexamples because they involve an independent factor, and that the alleged type (ii) counterexamples can be analyzed as involving multiple events. Tsohatzidis's attempt to dispute the claim in Progovac thus fails.},

  volume = {59},
  abstract = {This article investigates the role of syntactic and prosodic markedness constraints on the construction of phonological phrases (/- or p-phrases) in Catalan. It is shown that the construction of prosodic structure in this language cannot solely rely on syntactic information but rather also has to refer to prosodic markedness constraints which regulate the size and eurhythmicity of phrase constituents. Specifically, phonological phrasing in Catalan is determined, among other things, by the interaction of right-alignment of syntactic and phonological phrases (Align-XP,R; Selkirk 1986) and the requirement that each XP is contained in a p-phrase (Wrap-XP; Truckenbrodt 1995) together with the following set of prosodic factors: 1) a maximal requirement on the length of p-phrases at the end of utterances, Max-Bin-End, which requires that each p-phrase containing a nuclear stress should contain at most two prosodic words; 2) a minimality constraint on the prosodic parsing of utterances, Min- Utt, which requires that each utterance contains a minimally binary p-phrase; 3) a eurhythmic condition, No-Clash, which does not allow the presence of two immediately adjacent stressed syllables, partly affects phrasing decisions in this language. Size and eurhythmic effects of this type are also active, though in a weaker fashion, in other Romance languages such as Italian (Ghini 1993a, 1993b), in Brazilian Portuguese (Sandalo \& Truckenbrodt 2002), and in European Portuguese and Spanish (Elordieta et al. 2003, Prieto (forthcoming)).},

  abstract = {In this paper, I argue that the temporal connective prima (`before') is a comparative adverb. The argument is based on a number of grammatical facts from Italian, showing that there is an asymmetry between prima and dopo (`after'). On the ground of their divergent behaviour, I suggest that dopo has a different grammatical status from prima. I propose a semantic treatment for prima that is based on an independently motivated analysis of comparatives which can be traced back to Seuren (in: Kiefer and Ruwet (eds.) Generative grammar in Europe, 1973). Dopo is analyzed instead as an atomic two-place predicate which contributes a binary relation over events to the sentence meaning. The different semantic treatments of the two connectives provide an explanation for the grammatical asymmetries considered at the outset; interestingly, they also shed some light on other asymmetries between prima and dopo, which are known to hold for the English temporal connectives before and after as well: these asymmetries are related to the veridicality properties, the distribution of NPIs, and the logical properties of these connectives first de- scribed in Anscombe (Philos Rev 73:3\textendash{}24, 1964).},

The innovation lies in examining what happens when the relation between the relevant agreement morphology and the full noun phrase fails to obtain: whether the agreement morpheme still shows up, bearing default phi-features, or disappears altogether. The workings of the proposed diagnostic are demonstrated using a family of constructions in ``substandard'' Basque (Etxepare 2006). Besides supporting the proposed diagnostic, the analysis of Basque provides a new perspective on the typological status of the Basque agreement system, as well as evidence against the traditional analysis of unergatives in Basque as being underlyingly transitive.},

I provide a principled explanation for the impossibility of variable binding into, and extraction from, As-parentheticals, and argue that this construction yields novel support for the view (of Ladusaw 1992, and others) that negative DPs like no one are actually non-negated indefinites licensed by an abstract, clause-level negation. Overall, the analysis shows that parentheticals, in addition to being a rich source of puzzles in their own right provide a useful probe into clause structure in general.},

This paper uses sluicing (IP ellipsis) in Malagasy to argue that this parallelism requirement is a semantic restriction and not a syntactic one. An elided constituent must be semantically parallel to its antecedent but need not have parallel syntactic structure (Merchant, 2001). In Malagasy, wh-questions are pseudoclefts. Given that antecedent clauses are not pseudoclefts, sluicing is ruled out if syntactic parallelism is necessary. Sluicing is correctly allowed if there is only a semantic parallelism requirement. The paper considers an alternative that would avoid this conclusion: Malagasy wh-questions are clefts and the construction under investigation is pseudosluicing (Merchant, 1998), which is not subject to a linguistic parallelism requirement. This alternative is shown to be untenable.},

The Austronesian language family, with its over 1000 members, is taken as a starting point for the investigation because of its abundance of verb-initial languages. The existing analyses of Austronesian languages support one potential universal in this domain: Languages that derive verb-initial word order by VP raising do not have wh-movement. Possible theoretical explanations for this pattern are evaluated. The paper then considers Fijian, a potential counterexample. Further analysis suggests that Fijian is unlikely to be a problem, however, it highlights a main claim of the paper: Careful, in-depth analyses are required to yield robust results in such a typological study.},

This paper presents an analysis of the relationship between imperatives and priority modals in discourse which asserts that, just as declaratives contribute to the Common Ground and thus provide information relevant to the interpretation of epistemic modals in subsequent discourse, imperatives contribute to another component of the discourse context, the addressee's To-Do List, which serves as a contextual resource for the interpretation of priority modals. This analysis predicts that the interpretation of imperatives and modals in discourse is constrained in surprising ways; these predictions are borne out.},

This assumption plays a central role in phonological theory. Discreteness at the phonetic level guarantees the discreteness of all other levels of language. But decades of phonetics research demonstrate that there exists no universal inventory of phonetic objects. We discuss three kinds of evidence: first, phonologies differ incommensurably. Second, some phonetic characteristics of languages depend on intrinsically temporal patterns, and, third, some linguistic sound categories within a language are different from each other despite a high degree of overlap that precludes distinctness. Linguistics has mistakenly presumed that speech can always be spelled with letter-like tokens. A variety of implications of these conclusions for research in phonology are discussed.},

Most scholars contend that the variant expressions are selected accordign to distinctions in the way the speaker envisions the future eventuality and/or the semantic and/or pragmatic import s/he wishes to convey. Curiously, however, there is little agreement as to what that import is nor which of the variants is capable of expressing it. Making use of a variationist approach, in this paper we return to the qeustion of the function and meaning of the major exponents of futurity in spoken French through systematic analysis of thousands of contexts of future emporal reference in natural speech. We show that although the variant forms continue to divide up the work of expressing posteriority, they are rarely selected by speakers in accordance with the values commonly attributed to them in either the descriptive or prescriptive literature. This is because basically all reference to future states or events is made by periphrastic future, which as ousted inflected future from virtually all contexts of productive usage but one, while futurate present has made only incipient incursions into another. We suggest that failure to attain consensus on the set of meanings or functions distinguishing the variatns is the product of an epistemological problem stemming from difficulty in reconciling the form-function polyvalence characteristic of inherent variability with the (distributional) linguistic enterprise of ascribing a unique function to every form.},

By drawing on Labov's methods for a restudy of MV forty years later, we establish (i) the validity of apparent-time inferencing, and (ii) the robustness of social indexing for the (ay) and (aw) variables on MV.

Thus any operation that consisted of Move alpha alone, without Form Chain, is cost-free. Prior to the examination of any data, I explore the properties that Move alpha without Form Chain is predicted to possess. I then examine two optional movements, Icelandic Stylistic Fronting and "semantically vacuous" cases of Japanese scrambling, and show that they possess precisely the predicted properties.},

To acquire all number words with their meanings as a basis for further mathematical thinking\textemdash{}at least other numerals than those for small numerosities like [two] or [three] (and maybe [ four])\textemdash{}a child has to learn a number sequence as a list of speech forms meaningless at first. It is claimed that general principles of rhythm and coordination explain the child's ability to learn by rote a sequence of such speech forms and their word class. I show that these principles also apply in the acquisition of sequences of the names of the days of the week and the names of the months. As far as the development of the counting abilities for numbers up to [a hundred] is concerned, I argue that the particular rhythmical structure of the sequence provides the child with the raw material to develop a concept ``decade word.'' The child will have to learn by rote a second sequence, that is, the sequence of the decade numbers [10, 20, 30, etc.]. This is an important step in the detection of the algorithm that ultimately makes the generation of all natural numbers possible. I argue that the theory of reduction from Lerdahl and Jackendoff's (1996) generative theory of music may explain this step.},

We focus on Chinese reflexive ziji but will also consider reflexives in American English and British English. Data from these languages indicate that obligatory binding (as stated in Principle A of Chomsky (1986)) is something of a special case and should not be taken as a general model for a cross-linguistic approach to reflexives. We also show that argument structure is relevant to long-distance binding in Chinese, and thus the syntactic binding domain can be defined in terms of relative OBLIQUENESS of grammatical relations rather than a purely tree-configurational relation, e.g., C-COMMAND.},

The phenomenon, in which a verb may agree with a constituent inside its clausal complement, poses a serious challenge to theories of agreement locality. In a number of formal syntactic theories, agreement between a head and an argument reflects some very local clause-mate configuration, often specifier-head. We demonstrate that this is inadequate for a satisfactory analysis of LDA and we propose an alternative that appeals to a less local configuration resembling head government. Crucial to our analysis of LDA is the generalization that LDA is triggered by a constituent wich must be a topoic. We argue that the agreement trigger moves covertly to an A' topic position within its own clause where it is in a local agreement configuration with the verb. Independent evidence for covert movement adn the existence of configurations which block LDA support the analysis. The primary conclusion is that syntactic agreement cannot be reduced to a specifier-head configuration in all cases. The theory must allow a less local configuration in which the target simply governs the agreement trigger.},

We also review some constructions which, while superficially resembling backward or copy structure, do not provide any evidence for a movement chain.

With respect to the syntax of the sentential complement of these verbs, it is shown that analyses of raising and ECM in terms of a 'reduced' sentential complement are theoretically and empirically untenable. An analysis of raising is developed which requires two steps: in the embedded CP complement of seem/believe, AgrsP first moves to Spec CP before the subject in the embedded Spec AgrsP moves to the matrix Spec Agrs/oP (seem/believe) position. The first step is motivated as Focus-movement, and allows for an explanation of the relation of seem type verbs to verbs of comparison in many languages. The presence of a [+Focus] C inthe sentential complement of seem/believe also accounts for Focus-related restrictions on the subject of the embedded complement of believe type verbs, which were observed by Postal (1974) for a subset of English ECM verbs (his DOC-verbs) and by Kayne (1981) and Pollock (1985) for French ECM verbs.},

  abstract = {Sluiced wh phrases have been claimed to escape strong islands, with one exception: when the sluiced wh phrase has no overt correlate in the antecedent clause (i.e., when it corresponds to an implicit indefinite), the elided IP cannot contain a strong island from which the wh phrase has been extracted. This paper argues against a previous LF approach to the island snensitivity of antecedentless Sluicing, and, showing that htis is just one case of a wider phenomenon, it derives it from the interaction of two independenlty motivated factors: the scope parallelism in ellipsis constructions in general \textendash{} implemented in terms of Rooth's Focus Condition \textendash, and the narrow scope of implicit indefinites. These two ingredients derive the following generalization: antecedentless Sluicing is usually ungrammatical when an operator \textendash{} no matter whether it constitutes a strong island or not \textendash{} intervenes between the sluiced wh phrsae and its trace. It also predicts that, in some particular cases, this type of Sluicing will succeed even when there is or appears to be an intervenor. These cases will follow from the Focus Condition (through implicational bridging) and from the interplay of several pragmatics and discourse factors: E-type pronouns, Modal Subordination, discourse constraints on anaphora and presupposition accomodation.},

Depending in part on the different inner makeup, demonstratives may or must move to Spec,DP. Furthermore, reinforcers come in two types: `bare' reinforcers are merged in the same Specifier as demonstratives; PP- reinforcers are right-adjoined. Assuming that there is no Subextraction out of Specifiers or Adjuncts, we can also explain a number of patterns that, although logically conceivable, do not occur in any language.},

Adjunction is argued to be mediated by a Modifier Phrase (Rubin, E.J., Proceedings of the West Coast Conference on Formal Linguistics, CSLI, Stanford, 429\textendash{}439, 1996).

  volume = {21},
  abstract = {In this paper, we argue that certain Slavic reflexive clitics should be analyzed as indefinite defective pronouns in both syntax and semantics, and we go on to identify syntactic and semantic parametric variation among refelxicve clitics in Slavic. Reflexive clitics that correspond to "people" represent nominative indefinite pronouns in Polish and Slovenian, and accusative indefinite pronouns in all the Slavic langauges, so there is syntactic variation among such indefinties. In syntax, indefinite clitics stand for explicit arguments that are defective because they contain a hman feature and no gender, number, or person and move to repair deficiency. In sematnics, they contain human variables and quantifiers reminiscent of "some," which can be deleted by existential disclosure. When quantifiers are deleted and adverbs bind indefintie clitics, such clitics may resemble "everyone," "many people," and "few people." In constructions with datives, Slavic clitics display a complex web of semantic and syntactic variation due to dative existential disclosure in logical form. Dative existential disclosure combines quantifier deletion with one of two operations binding datives to disclosed variables. In Polish and Slovenian, constructions with indefinite clitics and datives have the same syntax but differ in truth conditions because quantifiers are delted, and datives bind disclosed variables in one way in Polish and another way in Slovenian. In Czech and Bulgarian, dateive existential disclosure affects refelxive clitics standing for implicit arguemtns with different syntactic properties. Thus, there is syntactic variation, with Polish and Slovenian forming one sytnactic group and Bulgarian and Czech another. Variation extends to semantics, because the meaning of constructions with reflexive clitics and datives is the same in Bulgarian and slovenian, while Czech belongs to the same semantic group as Polish.},

Such a sentence combines a dative logical subject Ivan with an inflected verb rabote{\v s}e `work', and roughly corresponds to `Ivan was in a working mood', so does not entail that Ivan worked. I argue that such constructions consist of two core ingredients that account both for their syntactic properties, and for their modal flavor as dispositions. One ingredient is an Imperfective Operator in Viewpoint Aspect as the source of modality. Such an Operator resembles in syntactic and semantic properties both the Progressive Operator in so-called English Futurates such as For two weeks, the Red Sox were playing the Yankees today, and the Spanish modal Imperfecto. The other ingredient is a High Applicative Phrase with an oblique subject, which, other than determining syntactic properties, contributes to a difference in modal flavor with English Futurates. English Futurates denote plans, and a hypothesis is that this is due to their nominative subjects being paired to a presupposition giving them control over the intended event. By contrast, the Slavic constructions in this paper denote dispositions, not plans, because their oblique subjects cannot be paired with a similar presupposition.},

  title = {Variation in {{Finnish Vowel Harmony}}: {{An OT Account}}},
  volume = {17},
  abstract = {This paper presents data on vowel harmony with disharmonic roots in Finnish which show that when the last harmonic vowel in a disharmonic root is back, in almost all cases the only possible harmonic suffix vowel is back, but when the last harmonic vowel is front, there is usually variation in suffix vowel choice that seems to be influenced by several factors, including sonority and stress. These data, which cannot easily be accounted for in rule-based theories, can be accounted for in Optimality Theory. A highly ranked alignment constraint accounts for harmony with native roots and loans in which the last harmonic vowel is back. Unranked constraints, which tie suffix vowel choice to stress and sonority, as well as alignment requirements, determine suffix vowel quality for the remainder of forms. Variation is seen to be a function of the relative freqauency with which a particular suffix vowel is designated as aptimal by the different possible rankings of the unranked constraints.},

  title = {Infixing {{Reduplication}} in {{Pima}} and {{Its Theoretical Consequences}}},
  volume = {24},
  abstract = {Pima (Uto-Aztecan, central Arizona) pluralizes nouns via partial reduplication. The amount of material copied varies between a single C (mavit / ma-m-vit `lion(s)') and CV (hodai / ho-ho-dai `rock(s)'). The former is preferred unless copying a single C would give rise to an illicit coda or cluster, in which case CV is copied. In contrast to previous analyses of similar patterns in Tohono O'odham and Lushootseed, I analyze the reduplicant as an infix rather than a prefix. The infixation of the reduplicant can be generated via constraints requiring the first vowel of the stem to correspond to the first vowel of the word. Furthermore, the preference for copying the initial consonant of the word can be generated by extending positional faithfulness to the base-reduplicant relationship. I argue that the infixation analysis is superior on two grounds. First, it reduces the C vs. CV variation to an instance of reduplicant size conditioned by phonotactics. Second, unlike the prefixation analyses, which must introduce a new notion of faithfulness to allow syncope in the base just in the context of reduplication (e.g. ``existential faithfulness'' (Struijke 2000a)), the infixation analysis uses only independently necessary constraints of Correspondence Theory.},

In the present article, one such issue is broached, viz., that of the choice between substitution adn adjunction. The obvious solution of eliminating one of the two options is rejected on empirical grounds, but for the subdomain of head movement it is possible to formulate a theory which will decide whether a particular instance of head movement is a case of adjunction or of substitution. The crucial factor will be seen to be 'adjacency'. The Head Adjacency Principle (HAP) in effect says that any instance of head movement which does not take place under adjacency must be a case of substitution. Evidnce for this proposal is presented from a variety of langauges and constructions, with particular emphasis on the analysis of the contraction beween prepositions and articles, analyzed as D-to-P Raising, in German.},

  abstract = {It is a well-known fact that most of the Germanic languages can use modal verbs iwth non-verbal complements. In the present paper I will focus on modals with directional PPs such as the German $\backslash$emphIch muss nach hause. There are two ways to analyze such constructions. Either we say that the modal can (also) be used as a main verb, in which case it can have a complete theta-structure, a full-blown subcategorization frame (e.g., Barbiers (1995), or we can say that, among the verbal complements the modal verb can combine with, thereis a super-light motion verb [e]GO. Swiss German presents us with the two incontrovertible arguments to the effect that there has to be an empty GO. Teh first, due to J. Hoekstra (1997), is based on the distributionj of PPs in verbal clusters. A second argument comes from Verb Doublling. Dutch and German differ from Swiss German in this prespect. It is tempting to assume that these languages lack the empty GO. However, West Flemish confronts us with a paradox: according to one argument it must have empty GO, accoridng to the other it must lack it. The only way in which the paradox can be resolved, it is argued, is to assume that all varieties (there are relevant additional data from Afrikaans, Alsatian, German, Frisian, and Luxemburgish) have the phonetically empty super-light motion verb GO but that the variation is due to a 'Pure Parameter'. This parameter, the Projection Parameter, is argued to regulate the licensing of empty light motion verbs as well as the occurrence of Verb (Projection) Raising.},

It also captures linguistically relevant generalizations that cannot be expressed in other theories. The approach is formalized in terms of complex recursive schemata structured in a multiple inhertance hierarchy, without positing lexical rules or lexical entries for affixes. These schemata structure the existing lexicon, reducing redundancy, and at the same time serve as the basis for productive word formation. The approach handles zero-drivation adn other nonconcatenative morphology straightforwardly.},

EP predicts that the search space for feature checking should increase throughout the derivation with the growth of the phrase marker. This prediction is shown to be manifested in ``agreement displacement,'' where agreement morphology under certain conditions cross-references a noncanonical argument. Agreement displacement shows that u-features of a head may seek a DP outside the complement of that head, after the cycle on which search exhausts the complement, as predicted by EP. A detailed look at Basque ergative displacement, which differentially affects person and number, leads to the conclusion that agreement may happen only once per interpretable feature. The blocking of multiple Agree relationships is implemented as a locality effect, based on the construal of Case as a functional category introduced by Agree.},

The approach proposes that the constraint is due to the interference in person Agree of a head H and its expected controller A by a dative between the two. This predicts that it is absent if the dative does not intervene, or if A moves past the dative. Both predictions are correct. The latter is developed at length from Basque ‘‘absolutive displacement" and Icelandic ‘‘long raising," which show the predicted repair of the constraint by movement, through anomalous ergative morphology and overt displacement respectively. A further correct consequence is that the constraint is repaired undetectably in the unaccusatives of accusative languages, except when movement past the dative is unavailable. Morphology does not provide the right tools, since it collapses the required structural distinctions, and the saving effect of movement on agreement is unpredicted. Finally, an independent argument is developed to show that the Person Case Constraint is visible to ‘‘narrow syntax."},

Rather, it is assumed that they must be interpretable in situ, and that syntactic conditions like 'superiority' are effects of economy, which restricts overt rather than covrt movement of a wh-element. The remaining syntactic problem for this line of reasoning is the putative ECP effects of adverbial wh-adjuncts, which were the strongest evidence for covert movement. A serious semantic problem is that the interpretative procedures which have been proposed for wh-in-situ \textendash{} unselective binding or absorption \textendash{} fail to capture correctly their interpretation. I will argue first that both problems are solved if the interpretation in situ employs choice functions, and it is the function variable, rather than an individual variable, which is long-distance bound by the question existential operator. Adverbial adjuncts, which cannot be interpreted via choice functions, cannot, therefore, be interpreted in situ. However, the concept of economy underlying the account of overt superiority effects requires both theoretical and empirical clarification (as it leaves some empirical problems unaddressed). I argue, following a proposal by Golan (1993), that in this case the economy considerations apply at the interface ('interface economy') and that they consider not only different derivations out of the same numeration, but also their semantic representation.},

I argue that this cost is directly visible at the acquisition stage: In those linguistic areas in which it has been independently established that such computation is indeed at work, experiments have consistently found group performance at the range of 50 percent (in dual-choice tasks). The proposed explanation is that children are aware of the innately required computation, but they cannot carry it out because of their limited working-memory resources, and they resort instead to strategies that enable bypassing it.$\backslash$ $\backslash$ Previous stides have extablished already the 50 percent range of performance in the acquisition of 2 areas requiring reference set compuatation \textendash{} coreference (Condition B) and implicatures. In this study, I examine the acquisition of stress shift and focus. I argue that compuating the focus obtained by stress shift requires constructing a comparison set. Contrary to some prevailing views, there is no evidence tha tchildren have general problems with stress, but still, one finds the 50 percent range of perfromance when stress shift applies as predicted by the processing cost hyptohesis. Analysis of the explanations children give for their answers has revelaed that they are attempting to construct the relevant comparison derivaiton, but they get stuck at that stage. Combined with the anlysis of individual responses, 2 bypassing strategies are found in this area: one is simple guessing, dominant in tasks involving switch reference with stress shift in whihc one finds individual performance at the range of 50 percent. The other, dominant in tasks involving semantic disambiguation, is the selection of an arbitrary default, which may be fixed for a given child across tasks. However, because the choice of the default is itself arbitrary, the group results remain at the 50 percent range.},

This conclusion gives rise to an apparent mismatch between syntactic structure (narrow scope of if) and semantic interpretation (wide scope of if). To resolve this paradoxical situation, I propose a compositional semantics for conditionals that is based on the idea that (indexed) if is to be construed as some kind of anaphor (variable) that ranges over objects of type modal base picking up a modal background in the actual context. Even though this analysis assigns a non-vacuous semantics to the complementizer if, it is still com- patible with the syntax of Asymmetric Coordination in German, and, in contrast to alternative accounts, avoids the generation of non-existent distributive readings.},

Structures of this sort have been traditionally analyzed as passive, but we show that in European Portuguese they are active. This is not obvious at first, for in fact the object agreeing withthe verb can prepose in ways which resemble passivization. The first half of this paper is devoted to showing that this preposing is not NP-Movement at all. This in turn leads to a few questions around the peculiarity of the construction: Why does an active object exhibit subject agreement? When and how is this possible? How does this object get licensed? What is the subject of the construction and what are its properties? These questions have an obvious general interest but are particularly significant within the minimalist program of Chomsky (1995b), which has mechanisms ensuring that objects of transitive configuratoins do not move to the position that licenses subject agreement, contrary to what happens in this construction. We express our findings within this framework.},

From this perspective, mood morphology conveys information about model flow in discourse, which can be determined by a variety of factors ranging from lexical meaning of embedding predicates to different aspects of discourse interpretation and context change. The proposal identifies and analyzes the parameters that induce model shift in subordinated domains. This allows us to distinguish core cases of subjunctive selection from more peripheral ones, both within a language and crosslinguistically, and it also provides us with an explanation for several empirical problems that a rigid interpetation of mood leaves unresolved. The analysis offered concentrates on mood distribution in Catalan and Spanish.},

  abstract = {Higher order unification is a way of combining information (or equivalently, solving equations) wxpressed as terms of a typed higher order logic. A suitably restricted form of the notion has been used as a simple and perspicuous basis for the resolution of the meaning of elliptical expressions and for the interpretation of some non-compositional tyipes of comparative construction also involving ellipsis. This paper explores another area of application for this concept in the interpretation of sentences containing intonationally marked 'focus', or various semantic constructs which are snesitive to focus. Similarities and differences between this approach, and theories using 'alternative semantics', 'structured meanings', or flexible categorial grammars, are described. The paper argues that the higher order unification approach offers descriptive advantages over these alternatives, as well as the practical advantage of being capable of fairly direct computational implementation.},

  volume = {73},
  abstract = {The forms represented orthographically as (wanna), (gonna), (gotta), (oughta), (usta), and (sposta) have standardly been analyzed as involving a syntactic rule or cliticization operation called to-contraction. Occasionally it has been suggested that the forms in question have been 'lexicalized', i.e., WANNA and HAFTA are synchronically distinct lexemes from WANT and HAVE. I argue here that neither approach is correct. The syntactic accounts are wrong to assume that the relation between wanna and want to must be syntactic, and the lexicalizaiton accoutns are wrong to assume that there is no synchronic relation: the link is one of derivational morphology. A morpholexical rule suffixes /tu/ /te/ tot he base lexcemes to form derived lexemes such as WANNA. These to-derivates are headed morphological structures, as described by Stump 1994. They inflect on their heads, not their edges; they are sysnonymous with their bases but have different subcategorization and more colloquial style associations. Various morphologcial and phonological sharing of the lexical idiosyncrasies of the bse lexemes show that they contain those bases as heads. All the syntactic phenomena that have been claimed to be relevant to the debate overt to-contraction fall into place under the assumptions advocated here, and some new insights emerge, particularly with regard to the 'liberal dialects' where the pronunciation written $<$wanna$>$ has wider distribution than in most American dialects.},

  abstract = {This paper examines the question of how so-called indeterminate phrases in Japanese (Kuroda 1965) associate with relevant particles higher in the structure. In the universal construction in Japanese, the restrictor (provided by an indeterminate phrase) sometimes appears to be separate from the universal particle mo. It is proposed that quantification at a distance is only apparent, and that the restriction is in fact provided locally by the sister constituent of mo as a whole. The proposal leads us to a straightforward uniform picture of the syntax-semantics mapping of the universal construction and wh-questions, building upon Hamblin's (1973) semantics for wh-phrases as sets of alternatives. It allows for a switch of perspective on a long-standing puzzle regarding locality effects in the indeterminate\textendash{}particle association by deriving the locality pattern from the way indeterminate phrases are interpreted and associated with particles, without any stipulations.},

It is argued that the predicates and the SFPs in Chinese sentences must agree in the [=/1 dynamic] features in syntax. It is also argued that Chinese has two light verbs: the static light verb $\backslash$emphslv adnt he dynamic light verb $\backslash$emphdlv. These two light verbs, in conjunction with the lexical verbs, determine the event structures of thepredicates in Chinese, and furthermore serve as the basis for the syntactic agreement of the aspectuality between the SFPs and the predicates. In this article I also compare the SFPs and predicates in Chinese adn Japanese. Based on empirical evidence, I propose that Japanese lacks syntactic aspect agreement, in sharp contrast with Chinese.},

It is claimed that the type of sentence which embeds the relative clause affects the binding options inside it. A relative clause formed of a chain that ends in a trace triggers functional/pair-list readings regardless of the type of sentence which embeds the relative clause. On the other hand, a relative clause formed of a chain that ends in a pronoun needs to be embedded in an equative sentence in order to trigger such readings. Theis effect is argued to follow from the constraints which govern resumptive pronouns, one of which being that they require salient discourse antecedents. It is also shown that previous analyses which attempt to derive the pronoun/trace alternation from syntactic principles alone fail to account for the equative/non-equative contrast.},

  volume = {29},
  abstract = {We present a general theory of scope and binding in which both crossover and superiority violations are ruled out by one key assumption: that natural language expressions are normally evaluated (processed) from left to right. Our theory is an extension of Shan's (2002) account of multiple-wh questions, combining continuations (Barker, 2002) and dynamic type-shifting. Like other continuation-based analyses, but unlike most other treatments of crossover or superiority, our analysis is directly compositional (in the sense of, e.g., Jacobson, 1999). In particular, it does not postulate a level of Logical Form or any other representation distinct from surface syntax. One advantage of using continuations is that they are the standard tool for modeling order-of-evaluation in programming languages. This provides us with a natural and independently motivated characterization of what it means to evaluate expressions from left to right. We give a combinatory categorial grammar that models the syntax and the semantics of quantifier scope and wh-question formation. It allows quantificational binding but not crossover, in-situ wh but not superiority violations. In addition, the analysis automatically accounts for a variety of sentence types involving binding in the presence of pied piping, including reconstruction cases such as Whose criticism of hisi mother did each personi resent?},

Weight is described by each of the prenominal expressions in heavy rock, too much ballast, 2 pound rock, 2 pounds of rocks. The central claim of this paper is that the position of these types of expressions within the noun phrase limits the kinds of dimensions they may describe. The limitations have to do with whether or not the dimension tracks relevant part-whole relations. An analogy is made between these constraints and the well-known constraints on thematic relations that are incurred by the position of a noun phrase in a clause. A proposal is made about the meanings of expressions like too much and 2 pounds which explains their common cross-categorial distribution and this informs the analysis of their use in noun phrases. A position is taken on the meaning of the count mass distinction which, in conjunction with the hypothesis about dimensions, explains asymmetries in the distribution of prenominal adjectives with count and mass nouns.},

The focus is on odd coordinations in which und has a full non-finite verb phrase to its immediate right but only a verb phrase fragment to its immediate left. In the analysis of Heycock and Kroch (1994), wuch 'verbal' odd coordinations arise by asymmetric extraction from a first verb phrase coordinate. It is shown here that this analysis misses a robust empirical generalization: in verbal odd corrdinations, the string preceding und must always form a grammatical sentence in isolation. It is argued that this gneeralization can be derived from the Coordinate Structure Constraint, which bans asymmetric extraction. In the spirit of Wilder (1994), it is furthermore argued that grammatical verbal odd corrdinations derive from coordinations of larger phrases which are reduced by Gapping. It is shown that this leads to a unified analysis of verbal odd coordinations and analogous 'nominal' odd coordinations, in which und appears between a full noun phrase and a noun phrase fragment. Further issues addressed are operator scope and the availability of Left Deletion (Right Node Raising) in odd coordinations.},

This hypothesis is in turn derived from assumptions as to how the Logical Form of a reduced conditional relates to the one of its non-reduced version.

It is argued that examples which appear to motivate such a movement are to be reanalyzed as involving silent material at the left periphery of a second disjunct. It is shown in detail that a variety of observations on either/or disjunctions fall out from independently established properties of what Ross (1970) calls Gapping. It will also be concluded that in certain cases, second disjuncts host silent subject pronouns.

It is shown that by combining this approach with independent developments in semantics/pragmatics one can overcome certain limitations of Groenenedijk and Stokhof's (1984) proposal.

This paper argues that, together with an anti-locality constraint on movement (Grohmann, 2003) which prohibits overly local movement as elaborated in (i\textendash{}v), the occurrence of a canonically left dislocated subject in anti-agreement languages accounts for all syntax peculiar to the phenomenon in the Bantu language of Kinande: (i) subjects can extract long-distance even across islands; (ii) subjects are locally unextractable if the canonical subject/verb agreement occurs; (iii) local subject extraction requires a change in subject/verb agreement morphology; (iv) objects cannot locally extract even if they appear to do so; and (v) objects can extract longdistance; however, they are sensitive to islands. Evidence comes from an analysis of the distribution of nominal expressions in the language as well as in-depth examination of two different wh-question formation strategies in the language. This study also reveals that the last resort strategy in a language is relativized to what is first resort: if resumption is first resort, movement is last resort, and vice versa.},

This article argues that despite all obvious dissimilarities, a fundamentally uniform developmental process, shaped by consistent sociolinguistic and language-contact conditions, has operated in the individual instances of rerooting the English language in another territory. At the heart of this process there are characteristic stages of identity construction by the groups involved, with similar relationships between the parties in migration contact settings (i.e. the indigenous population and immigrant groups, respectively) having resulted in analogous processes of mutual accommodation and, consequently, similar sociolinguistic and structural outcomes. Outlining a basic developmental scenario, I suggest that speech communities typically undergo five consecutive phases in this process\textemdash{}FOUNDATION, EXONORMATIVE STABILIZATION, NATIVIZATION, ENDONORMATIVE STABILIZATION, and DIFFERENTIATION\textemdash{} and I describe the sociolinguistic characteristics of each one. This framework is then applied to case studies of seven different countries (Fiji, Hong Kong, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Australia, and New Zealand) which, I argue, are currently positioned at different points along the developmental cycle.},

  abstract = {According to a variety of tests, 'What John likes is himself" displays the same c-command relations as "John likes himself." But note of these relations appears to hold on the surface; this is the 'connectivity problem'. Revisionists maintain that the problematic examples are identity sentences with no hidden structure, but that none of our c-command tests is infallible. Conservatives claim that our c-command tests are reliable, but that the clause "John likes himself" is indeed present at some level of representation. Siding with the conservatives, we follow Ross's (1972) original insight and suggest that connectivity sentences equate a concealed question with an elided answer: "[What John likes] = [$\backslash$soutJohn likes himself]." new arguments are given for each component of the analysis, and it is shown that connectivity effects are obviated when the elements that are equated are referential rather than clausal. The correct truth-conditions are derived from the semantics of identity, together with Groenendijk and Stokhof's (1990) semantics for questions. The analysis is then extended to cases of DP connectivity, such as "his ory is himself," by usggesting that semantically dyadic nouns have an additional argument position, yielding the representation: "[?x his [worry x]] = [ $\backslash$southis [ worry himself]]." finally, it is shown that recent objections based on 'anti-connectivity' effects misfire, because the same facs hold of question-answer pairs, as expected on the present approach.},

The introduction of vehicle change into the theory of A'-chains is independently motivated as essential to capturing a robust adjunct/nonadjunct distinction in the reconstruction of pronoun-as-bound-variable readings that has not been discussed up to now; at the same time it predicts the class of "weakest crossover" environments.},

I propose that the apparent unbounded nature of the movement involved in RNR follows from the simple fact that rightward movement is actually, in principle, an unbounded type ofmovement. I propose, in addition, to analyze those cases where rightward movement appears to be bounded as the result of a derivational constraint proposed in recent work by Fox and Pesetsky (2004) which demands that certain instances of movement be order preserving.},

Itargues that existential sentences in Tagalog are formed on the basis of an unaccusative predicate that selects a noun phrase as its sole internal argument.

Additionally, this paper argues for an analysis of the definiteness effect in which the restriction follows from the requirement that the noun phrase that occurs in existential sentences (i.e., the ``pivo'') be a property denoting object. This proposal not only accounts for the class of noun phrases that are acceptable in Tagalog existential sentences, but also helps to shed light on various morphosyntactic aspects of existential sentences in the language, relating \textemdash{} in particular \textemdash{} to their impersonal clause structure, morphological case, as well as other properties.},

It also implies that, when an operator is for some reason assigned scope in an exceptional manner and escapes the usual syntactici restrictions on scope assignment, bound variable licensing will be exceptionally allowed as well.},

This hypothesis has more recently been revived and extended to other languages by de Hoop (1992) and Diesing (1992). In this paper, I will attempt to show that htere is insufficient empirical support for this generalization. Although the meaning of a structure containing an indefinite object NP undoubtedly varies with the position of the NP relative to other constituents, it is doubtful whether it can be shown that the semantics of the NP itself depends on its absolute position.},

Second, the overt raising account, which can account for the word order facts, still faces two main challenges; there remain important open questions about verb placement, and though none of the current approaches to extraction can easily explain it, extraction and raising-to-object interact in complex ways that are still not well understood. Third, the movement theory of control, which treats object control in a way parallel to overt raising-to-object, faces not only the challenges to the overt raising account, but several others particular to object control. Finally, the article describes the HPSG analysis of raising-to-object, which can account straightforwardly for the word order facts, and with the appropriate constraints can be extended to account for the extraction facts discussed.},

We provide an analysis of the Statimcets modals according to which they are akin to specific indefinites in the nominal domain. They introduce choice function variables which select a subset of the accessible worlds. Following Klinedinst, we assume distributivity over the resulting set of worlds. Statimcets modals thus receive a uniform interpretation as (distributive) pluralities. The appearance of variability in modal force arises because the choice function can select a larger or smaller subset of accessible worlds. Finally, we discuss the implications of our analysis for the investigation of modal systems in other languages.},

Some authors suggest that this is achieved via lexicosyntactic cues, while others argue that projection is based on intonational contours. We tested these hypotheses in an on-line experiment, manipulating the presence of symbolic (lexicosyntactic) content and intonational contour of utterances recorded in natural conversations. When hearing the original recordings, subjects can anticipate turn endings with the same degree of accuracy attested in real conversation. With intonational contour entirely removed (leaving intact words and syntax, with a completely flat pitch), there is no change in subjects' accuracy of end-of-turn projection. But in the opposite case (with original intonational contour intact, but with no recognizable words), subjects' performance deteriorates significantly. These results establish that the symbolic (i.e. lexicosyntactic) content of an utterance is necessary (and possibly sufficient) for projecting the moment of its completion, and thus for regulating conversational turn-taking. By contrast, and perhaps surprisingly, intonational contour is neither necessary nor sufficient for end-of-turn projection.},

In Macedonian, the major prosodic phenomenon affecting the placement of liis the option for certain sequences of words to share a single stress. In Bulgarian, two different prosodic phenomena are relevant: stressing of clitics after the negative element ne and inversion of initial clitics with the following verb. When these factors are controlled for, the syntax of li questions in the two languages is strikingly homogeneous. If no element is focused (i.e., moved to SpecCP), the, in both langauges, the tensed verb head-incorporates into li in C.

The Halle-Sagey model predicts that palatalization should be analyzed by assuming derivational levels and is thus at odds with the tenet of strict parallelism in Optimality Theory. In contrast, the Clements-Hume model appears to be able to achieve the same goal without recourse to derivational stages because it is based on the assumption that, in the ways relevant for palatalization, vowels and consonants are characterized by the same features. However, analysis of palatalization and related processes shows that this assumption is incorrect. The consequence is that derivational stages cannot be avoided and that the tenet of strict parallelism must be rejected.},

I begin by arguing against the Partee/Dowty distinction between a semantically null be of predication and a thematically relevant agentive be, and I propose that there is one semantically relevant verb whose grammatical role is to turn an AP predicate into a verbal one. The denotation of be must thus be a function from denotations of Adjective Phrases to denotation of Verb Phrases. I argue that these denotations are crucially different in kind: verbs (and thus VPs) denote eventualities, which are count entities and which are temporally locatalbe, while adjectives (and thus APs) deonte mass entities, which are states and which are not temporally locatable. Be thus denotes a locating function which maps from the mass to the count domain, and is the analogue of the 'packaging' function in the nominal domain. After a comparison between the mass/count distinction in the verbal and nominal domains, I show how this theory accounts for properties of be in small clause and progressive constructions which have hitherto been explained by positing a so-called agentive be.},

It is shown here that contextually-dependent weight, as Hayes (1994) calls it, is a consequence of simultaneously comparing monomoraic and bmoraic parses of closed syllables for constraint satsifaction. The weight of closed syllables is a consequence of constraint interaction that determines the moraicity of coda consonants. These constraints are shown to conflict with higher ranking metrical constraints leading to contextually-dependent weight. Two types of constraint interaction are discussed here (1) closed syllables are light, but contextually heavy to satisfy some higher ranking constraint and (2) closed syllables are heavy, but are contextually light for the same reason. The behavior of closed syllables with respect to the constraint hierarchy is contrasted with the behavior of vowels in the same context. The independent behavior of long vowels and closed syllables is shown here to follow from the different Correspondence constraints (McCarthy and Prince 1995) that determine the weight of vowels and closed syllables.},

  abstract = {This paper examines the surface realization of vowel sequences in languages with only monophthongal vowels. The first vowel of an underlying vowel sequence can surface as a glide or be deleted, among other patterns. These distributions are shown to follow from constraint interaction as defined by Prince and Smolensky's (1993) 'Optimality Theory'. Concomitant with these surface distributions is a long vowel that is traditionally analyzed as compensatory lengthening. In 'Optimality Theory', the length of the surface vowel and the distribution of prevocalic vowels are due to best-satisfying syllable well-formedness and input/output Correspondence constraints. The alternations affecting the first vowel of a sequence illustrate two main tenets of Optimality Theory. One is Parallelism, that is, the output form of a prevocalic vowel is determined by simultaneously comparing moraic and nonmoraic parses of the vowel for constraint satisfaction. The other main tenet explored here is that interlinguistic variation is due to different rankings of the same set of constraints. This is demonstrated by discussing the alternations affecting prevocalic vowels in four Aftrican langauges, Luganda, Etsako, Yoruba, and Kimatuumbi. The nature of constraint interaction in Optimality Theory is shown to account for certain generalizations of prevocalic vowel distribution.},

Data from a corpus study as well as the results of an experimental study are brought forward, showing that animacy and weight are independent factors.

Moreover, the analysis of the interaction of animacy and weight provides evidence that animacy can even dominate weight up to a certain cut-off point.

  abstract = {This paper provides an analysis of articles in two unrelated languages: St'at'imcets and English child language. The article system in these two languages display striking parallels, divergin in similar ways from that of English adult langauge. Our analysis involves a parametric difference between English and St'at'imcets. While in English adult language, article distinctions rely on the state of the common ground between speaker and hearer, in St'at'imcets they rely on speaker beliefs. Despite the similarites between the patterns of article use in St'at'imcets and child English, we propose that English-acquiring children set the parameter correctly for the English value very early, but that they initially lack a pragmatic conept requireing them to distinguish systematically between their own beliefs and the belief state of their interlocutor. Thsi neutralizes the distinction between the two parameter values, causing the article system of English-speaking children to optionally resemble that of St'at'imcets adults. In terms of language acquisition theory, our study supports a revised version of the Strong Continuity Hypothesis, according to which children obey all principles of Universal Grammar and set parameters as soon as the relevant input is available. Any structures deviating from target language structures result from an immature pragmatic system.},

It comprises the case forms used to spell out nominals that do not receive a case specification by assignment or other syntactic means. As such, it does not interact with the Case Filter, which is argued to be a purely syntactic constraint as opposed to a morphophonological one. It is shown that diverse phenomena in the distribution of pronouns in English can be parsimoniously treated using default case, and further that English can thereby be assimilated to ``richer'' case languages such as German, rather than being analyzed with arbitrary language-particular rules. A sampling of phenomena from other languages demonstrates that evidence for default case is widespread, and moreover, that crosslinguistic differences in case patterns can often be reduced to the choice of a default case.},

We present three distinct arguments, based on an interaction between raising and wh-movement in English, facts from agreement with group terms in British English, and multiple scrambing in Japanese. The arguments imply that the T-model is correct in supposing that the movement that affects both LF and PF must precede movement that affects only PF.},

  abstract = {This paper articulates a formal solution to the puzzle of child language learnability within the Principles and Parameters-based framework. The language learning (parameter setting) task requires, in principle, that the selection of syntactic knowledge be sufficienlty constrained for the child to arrive at the appropriate target grammar, expending a minimum of computational effort and time. Since previous L1 analyses impose very strict requirements on the learner, solutions are achieved only at a very high cost. Further, not only do the standard accounts frequently contradict fundamental empirical facts of child linguistic development, such as the degree of variability observed in the production of early grammatical structures regardless of input; the accounts also fail to consider a crucial aspect which impacts selection: the young child's innate potential to efficiently acquire multiple languages simultaneously. The primary aim of the current paper is to provide a computational model that demonstrates a ``bilingual universals'' (in the spirit of Roeper 1996) stage of development based on real world data. The proposed model actually reflects a more precise UG-based representation within early monolingual grammars, as well as plausibly accounting for variability found in child L1 grammars},

  abstract = {This paper investigates Italian complex predicates combining light vrebs with deverbal nominalizations in $\backslash$emph-ata, where the nominalizations select distinct light verbs according to the number of arguments of their base. The arguments of the light vrb are inherited from its non-light counterpart but interpreted with respect to the Lexical Conceptual Structure (LCS) of its complement. On the basis of this and other observations, this work proposes an explicit decomposition of arguments into (i) $\backslash$emphargument-variables, encoding argument properties but isolated from LCS and therefore void of interpretation, and (ii) $\backslash$emphthematic indices, linking argument-variables to LCS and thus enabling their interpretation. The proposed decomposition provides a deeper understanding of the operations affecting argument structures in complex predicates, recasting $\backslash$emphlight verb formation, thematic transfer, and $\backslash$emphargument suppression, in terms of finer grained operations exclusively targeting either argument-variables or thematic indices.},

  volume = {23},
  abstract = {Constraints on prosodic and syntactic well-formedness conflict with each other. This is particularly evident in the expression of new information focus, where the best prosodic position for main stress does not necessarily match the best syntactic position for the constituent being focused. Since focus must be stressed, either stress or the focused constituent must abandon their best position, violating either the syntactic or the prosodic constraints responsible for it. This paper argues for an optimality theoretic analysis of this conflict, showing how different focus paradigms reflect different rankings of the relevant syntactic and prosodic constraints. As we will see, only an optimality analysis can account for the paradigm of Italian focus while maintaining the kind of prosodic theory of main stress emerged from prosodic studies in the last two decades. Furthermore, the analysis extends naturally to focus paradigms in English, French, and Chichewa with no need for language-specific parametric devices. The conflicting nature of prosodic and syntactic constraints determines a complex crosslinguistic typology from a single set of universal constraints with interface conditions kept to an absolute minimum.},

  volume = {17},
  abstract = {It has been widely assumed since Kitagawa and Ross (Linguist Anal 9: 19\textendash{}53, 1982) that noun phrases in Chinese and Japanese are quite similar in structure. They are N-final in surface word order, they employ ``modifying markers'' (de in Chinese and no in Japanese) extensively, and they require classifiers for numeral expressions. In this paper, we argue that, contrary to appearance, they have quite distinct structures. We examine N'-ellipsis in the two languages and present sup- porting evidence for the hypothesis argued for by Simpson (in: Tang and Liu (eds.) On the formal way to Chinese languages, 2003), among others, that Chinese noun phrases are head-initial. According to this hypothesis, de is D, and a classifier heads another projection within DP. Japanese noun phrases, on the other hand, are head- final. No is a contextual Case marker, as proposed by Kitagawa and Ross (Linguist Anal 9: 19\textendash{}53, 1982), and classifier phrases are adjuncts modifying nominal projections. Our discussion shows that Kayne's (The antisymmetry of syntax, 1994) analysis of N-final relatives applies elegantly to Chinese but not to Japanese. It thus suggests that Japanese relative clauses are head-final throughout the derivation.},

This account crucially relies on close morphological analysis of inflected words. I will also adopt Kayne's (1994) antisymmetry hypothesis, both becasue it sharply narrows down morphologically-driven word-order predictons, and because it allows a more elegant account of West Germanic word order altenrtions, in the spirit of Zwart (1993b).},

Given the generally accepted claim of positional faithfulness to the onset (Lombardi, Natural Language and Linguistic Theory 13:39\textendash{}74, 1995; Beckman, Positional faithfulness, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, 1998; Casali, Resolving hiatus, University of California, Los Angeles, 1998), however, the coda saliency effect observed in Korean sonorant assimilation is intriguing. Drawing on a theory of Licensing by Cue and the P-map hypothesis (Steriade, Phonetics in phonology: The case of laryngeal neutralization, UCLA, 1997; Steriade, The phonology of perceptibility effects: The P-map and its consequences for constraint organization, UCLA, 2001), this study claims that coda saliency is a language-specific phonological reflex of the contrast asymmetry in the lexical representation and in acoustic cues. The asymmetry in functional load depending on the position is reflected in the perception of similarity, namely whether the difference between two alveolar sonorants is less distinctive or robust in word-initial vs. word-final position. Based on similarity ranking by reference to the perceptibility difference, this study argues that the marginally contrastive sonorant in the onset is more likely to be the target of neutralization than is the sonorant in the coda, whose contrastiveness is well-grounded in Korean phonology.},

Making use of the notion of speaker presupposition and common ground (Stalnaker 1998, 1999, 2002), I propose an analysis of sentential -le whereby the ``change of state'' interpretation is associated with a change expressed by propositions within a common ground, while the ``contrary to expectation'' interpretation is associated with a change expressed by propositions across common grounds. Contrary to what is sometimes assumed, both the ``change of state'' and the ``contrary to expectation'' interpretations involve changes across a temporal domain. The proposal is supported by a restriction in the occurrence of sentential -le with downward-entailing quantifiers. The analysis supports L\"obner's (1989) insight that already/schon is associated with a presupposition about a prior ``negative state'', and clarifies how the ``change of state'' associated with sentential -le is different from the one entailed by the occurrence of a telic situation.},

The work discussed in this paper is intended as a contribution to realizing this objective. We briefly introduce the phe- nomenon of NPIs and outline major theories about their licensing and also various licensing contexts before discussing our major topics: Firstly, a corpus-based retrieval method for NPI candidates is described that ranks the candidates according to their distributional dependence on the licensing contexts. Our method extracts single-word candidates and is extended to also capture multi-word candidates. The basic idea for automatically collecting NPI candidates from a large corpus is that an NPI behaves like a kind of collocate to its licensing contexts. Manual inspection and interpretation of the candidate lists identify the actual NPIs. Secondly, an online repository for NPIs and other items that show distributional idiosyncrasies is presented, which offers an empirical database for further (theoretical) research on these items in a sustainable way.},

I argue here that there is no attraction of the verb to the negative expression (i.e., no Negative Criterion) and that the apparent inversion is impeded movement where the elements involved (verb and subject) fail to arrive at the normal declarative surface positions. It is demonstrated that such an analysis accounts straightforwardly for a variety of phenomena that require complexity or dual analysis in IP/AgrP-external approaches to NI.},

An inability to resolve an active Case feature early results in the C-t effect. The dormant ``object'' case form is determined at PF either by a rule of default case (accusative) or by one of a set of rules assigning a prestige (usually nominative) case. This system correctly predicts a variety of details of the C-t effect and the possible occurrence and distribution of prestige case forms (It is I or between you and I ) where Case is dormant. The C-t effect in Spanish, Russian, and Polish are also briefly considered.},

It is proposed, assuming the split-CP hypothesis (cf. Rizzi 1997), that this category is Wh, an operator head whose specifier hosts wh-phrases. In addition, it is argued that V-raising to the CP domain is an operation not available to the child, even if the adult system displays this possibility. Evidence from the spontaneous speech production of three Portuguese children supports our hypothesis that the CP domain is active in the child grammar through XP movement and not through the movement of the verb. Finally, it will be shown that focalized \'e que-wh-questions is the sole strategy used by the referred children to form constituent interrogatives. The hypothesis is that this follows naturally from a preference for Merge over Move (cf. Chomsky 1995).},

On the basis of our results, we argue that acquisition of the entire class depends on the acuquisition of two parametric properties. One property allows the grammar to generate double object datives, causative/perceptual constructions, put-locatives, and V-NP-Particle constructions. V-Particle-NP constructions and to-datives depend on the combination of the first property with a second property.},

It motivates a small number of semantic features for events and their objects, such as whether an object exists independently of an event, whether it is totally affected by the event, and so on. It then formalizes these features. It also shows how they can be formalized in an algebraic framework and applied in a categorial grammar to derive the properties of verbal and nominal predicates. The result is an integration of descriptive semantics with algebraic theories of objects and events.},

Detailed investigation indicates that the surface forms are however derived from fully regular underlying strudctures via a process of focus-driven light predicate raising. Cross-linguistic variation in the paradigm then shows that the basic modal structure is currently in different stages of development in the languages investigated. In Canonese in particular, it is aruged that the trigger for VP-raising has now become fully fossilized and no longer reflects its original motivation. The paper concludes that certain movement operations may in general occur without any clearly understandable synchronic trigger. Formally, Chomsky's 'strong cateogrial/EPP features' are suggested to correspond precisely to this type of movement whose original motivation has weakened and become hidden during the course of language change.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses the question of whether 'main clause infinitival datives' in russian should be analyzed as oblique or 'quirky' subjects, in contrast to anoher type of subject-like datives in Russian, 'I-nominals'. In particular, it examines a claim to this effect made by Moore and Perlmutter (2000). By comparing the datives in question to Icelandic oblique subjects, above all with respect to agreement, the paper demonstrates that Moore and Perlmutter's arguments are untenable, i.e., their arguments do not distinguish between the two dative types in the way they claim. however, it does not follow that Russian infinitival datives are best analyzed as 'non-subjects'. Rather, it is argued, the interesting question raised by subject-like non-nominatives across languages is not whether they should be classified as subjects by some postulated standards, but what they tell us about the interaction of case and other featuers or properties of language, in particular sentence structure and agreement. The concluding section of the paper presents evidence that russian I-nominals differ from Icelandic quirky subjects in not entering into a 'quirky null-agreement' correlation with the finite complex of the clause. In contrast, it is pointed out, Russian infinitival datives could and probably should be analyzed as sharing this peculiar property with Icelandic 'quirks'.},

  abstract = {Icelandic case agreement suggests that nominative case is active in PRO infinitives in much the same way as in finite clauses, thus posing a difficult and a long-standing problem for generative (GB and minimalist) case theory and the PRO Theorem. In this article, I examine the Icelandic facts in detail, illustrating that the unmarked and common nominative morphology in Icelandic PRO infinitives is regular structural nominative morphology, suggesting that PRO cannot be reduced to a copy. What went wrong in the GB approach to PRO was not PRO itself but the binding theoretic and `Case' theoretic conception of it. PRO is an empty category that is simultaneously a reference variable (like overt pronouns and anaphors) and a phi-feature variable (unlike overt expressions). Due to this unique combination of variable properties, PRO cannot be deduced from other traits of grammar, such as movement, nor can it possibly be lexicalized. Importantly, also, the facts studied here suggest that case is a post-syntactic category, assigned in morphology. In contrast, Person is evidently a syntactically active category, having some of the properties and effects that have commonly been attributed to 'Case'.},

The article thus contributes to the program of eliminating statements in grammar in favor of general factors.

On the approach pursued, radically silent argu- ments\textemdash{}such as Germanic zero topics and controlled 3rd person null subjects in Finnish\textemdash{}commonly raise across a lexical C (a comple- mentizer or a verb-second (V2) verb) into the edge of the C-domain for the purpose of successful C/edge linking (circumventing C-inter- vention), thereby showing A \= -behavior not observed for other types of arguments (including the Romance type of pro). Silent arguments are universally available in syntax, whereas their C/edge linking is con- strained by factors (such as Germanic V2) that may or may not be present or active in individual languages and constructions.},

  abstract = {Abstract In biscuit conditionals (BCs) such as If you're hungry, there's pizza in the fridge, the if clause appears to apply to the illocutionary act performed in uttering the main clause, rather than to its propositional content. Accordingly, previous analyses of BCs have focused on illocutionary acts, and, this, I argue, leads them to yield incorrect paraphrases. I propose, instead, that BCs involve existential quantification over potential literal acts such as assertions, questions, commands, and exclamations, the semantic objects associated with declarative, interrogative, imperative, and exclamative sentences, respectively. Such an existential interpretation of BCs requires only that we add potential literal acts to our inventory of individuals, and it produces reasonable paraphrases in which if has its normal meaning: If you're hungry,[there's a (relevant/salient) assertion that] there's pizza in the fridge. These potential literal act variables are introduced into semantic interpretations and then undergo Existential Closure. Hence, we would expect to see similar interpretations in contexts other than BCs, that is, with other if constructions, with connectives other than if, with potential literal acts other than assertion, and in root sentences. This prediction is borne out, along with the parallel prediction that we cannot quantify over purely illocutionary acts like offers, but only over potential literal acts, those conventionally associated with a particular morphosyntactic shape.},

  abstract = {This paper offers an analysis of extraction and pied-piping in Tzotzil, a Mayan language, within the framework of Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG). In this language, pied-piping is accompanied by the obligatory reordering of elements with the piedin the pied-piped XP. This reordering is most evident in constituent questions wehre WH-pied-pipers always occur first in teh string and other elements follow in their normal, canonical order. Within CCG, these facts are accounted for by analyzing pied-pipers as rightward-looking functors from unsaturated NP or PP to functors over verbs or other predicates. By virtue of the lexically specified directionality of these functors and by virtue of a requirement in CCG that all combinatory rules respect this directionality when sanctioning combinations of functors with their arguments, the facts regarding the order of expressions in pied-piped phrases in Tzotzil fall out. No appeal to 'abstract agreement' or any other sort of phrase-structural relation is necessary. The paper demonstrates that the order of elements observed in pied-piped constituents in Tzotzil is an automatic consequence of the syntactic projection of lexical funciton/argument relations by means of the CCG rules of Functional Application and Functional Composition.},

This question is addressed here with respect to acquisition of phonotactics. On the assumption that the L2 initial state equals the native grammar's final state, learnability theory would predict that a lack of negative evidence for phonotactic structures that are illegal in the target language precludes acquisition of the target grammar. This prediction is tested for L1-Russian (superset) and L1-Spanish (subset) L2 learners of Dutch by means of word-likeness judgments and lexical decision experiments. Participants responded to nonwords containing consonant clusters in onsets and codas that are legal (1) only in Russian, (2) only in Russian and Dutch, or (3) in all three languages. The results converge to show that advanced L1-Russian and L1-Spanish L2 learners possess native-like phonotactic knowledge. Analysis shows that this knowledge cannot be attributed to transfer of lexical statistics from the native language. The results suggest that L2 phonotactic acquisition is not affected by subset/superset relations between the native language and target language. Some possible explanations for our findings are discussed.},

In particular, I show that an array of puzzling facts involving potential clitic hosts in a Northern Italian dialect can be understood once we adopt the view that object clitics must be taken to independently occupy distinct functional heads (in spite of phonological indications to the contrary). To show this, I establish that certain adverbs in this language occupy fixed positions within the clause. Once these positions are identified, I use them as probes to understand the position of the clitic. This paper also explores an independent consequence of this explanation of clitic placement: the position of argument prepositions with respect to the fixed object clitic indicates that there is an 'Aspectual Phrase' in the clauses's functional structure. I show that argument prepositions move from their base positions within VP to a functional projection which encodes the semantics of telicity, in contrast with non-argument prepositions (location adverbials), which do not exhibit such movement.},

Expletive pro and argumental pro are discussed and it is proposed that the D that licenses the former has no agreement features, whereas the D that licenses the latter has ``rich'' agreement.

In this study an analysis will be defended which treats -mente as a phrasal affix (cf. Zwicky 1987, Nevis 1985 and Miller 1992). The notion of phrasal affix has been used to describe clitics which, from a morphological standpoint, are similar to affixes but which, simultaneously manifest characteristics of independent words.

  abstract = {Moraic theory standardly syllabifies geminates in a coda-onset configuration whereby the coda bears a mora. Initial geminates pose a serious problem for the theory since word-initially no coda exists to host the first half of the geminate. Previous proposals have addressed this issue but have not resolved it satisfactorily, because they have created new difficulties pertaining to prosodification, syllabification or generation of insufficient or incorrect patterns. I propose that treating the geminate as a moraic onset simultaneously resolves all the issues above, provided we dispense with the stipulation that onsets are never moraic. An important prediction emerges from this proposal: onset geminates could also occur word-medially. I claim that such prediction is empirically confirmed in languages like Marshallese and Trique. I also argue that moraic theory is right in claiming that geminates are underlyingly moraic consonants \textendash{} rather than simply long \textendash{} and demonstrate how in the current model the contrast between geminates and singletons is preserved in all positions in the word.},

I give evidence that this phenomenon patterns with English verb phrase ellipsis (VPE) in a number of important respects. The same licensing conditions that must be satisfied in English VPE, including an inflectional checking requirement and an antecedence condition, must also be satisfied in Farsi v-stranding VPE.},

The starting point is the two adverbial expressions, dou and quan, both of which are often translated as all. Despite their syntactic and semantic similarities, closer examinations reveal that the occurrence of quan is more restricted than that of dou. While we concur with the view that dou can function as a distributive operator, we argue that quan itself is neither distributive nor quantificational. Its sole semantic function is to restrict the domain of distributive quantification. The incompatibility of quan in various environments is attributed to this single reason: quan is merely a domain regulator for distributivity.},

  title = {The {{Balkan Slavic Clausal Clitics}}},
  volume = {14},
  abstract = {The constituency and the behavior of the clausal clitics in Serbo-Croation, Macedonian and Bulgarian are analyzed. It is argued that, while in Serbo-Croation the clausal clitics are moved to CP and the cluster is formed in a node that is right-adjoined to C0, in Macedonian and Bulgarian the clitics are base-derived in IP, and the cluster is formed to the immediate left of V. The movement of clitics to CP reflects the propensity of the clitics in Common Slavic to occur in clitic-second or Wackernagel position. Nevertheless, this propensity is overruled to the extent to which the verb forms a local domain with the clitics. In Macedonian, where the verb does form a local domain with the clitics, the clitic cluster is formed in IP, to the immediately left of the finite verb, so that, when the verb moves, the cluster trails along (piggy-backing). In contrast, in Serbo-Croation, the verb does not form a local domain with the clitics and the clitic cluster is formed in reference to a specified syntactic position (the complementiser, in this case), rather than with reference to a specified syntactic category. In Bulgarian, where the verb and the clitics are weakly tied, the clitic cluster is formed in IP, but there is a discrepancy between syntactic and phonological 'allegiance'. Since the restriction on multiple adjunction in the specifiers to the left of Co follows from the clustering of the clitics in it, while the clitics cluster in Co if they do not form a local domain with the finite verb of their cluase, we may conclude that the Wackernagel Effect indirectly depends on whether or not the clitics form a local domain with that verb. The discrepancy between the syntactic and phonological behavior of the Bulgarian clitics can be explained by the fact that the propensity of the Bulgarian finite verb to form a local domain with the clitics s still weak, so that, while their syntactic properties have changed, the phonological properties of the Bulgarian clitics reflect those of their common Slavic ancestor.},

  title = {The {{Macedonian Negation Operator}} and {{Cliticization}}},
  volume = {19},
  abstract = {The paper focuses on the interaction bewteen clitics and the negation operator, and on how this interaction affects stress in different dialects of Macedonian. The basic claims are, first, that there is no free variation in the relationship of hte clitics and the negation operator; the variation is, instead, only across dialects; and, second, that the phonological relationship of hte clitics to the negation operator depends on teh strength of Neg and on the values for the verbal, [+/-V], and the nominal, [+/-N], features of the head of the clause. In the dialect in which Neg is strong, the clitics encliticize to it. In the dialect with a weak Neg we have two distinct strategies. In clauses in which V is instantiated by a [+V, -N] category, the negation operator merges and forms a single phonological word with V and any modal, auxiliary, or pronomoinal clitics that find themselves wedged between Neg and V. IN clauses in which V is instantiated by a [+V, +N] cateogry, however, the negation operator merges and forms a single phonolgoical word only with the clitics, to the exclusion of the instantiation of V. Since the clitics in clauses with [+V, -N] heads are typically verbal, while the clitics in cluases with [+V, +N] heads gravitate towards a second position, the analysis has an important theoretical ramification: it contributes to determing the relationship between second position and verbal clitic placement.},

In other areas the admissibility of linguistic testimony has been more controversial, including author and speaker identification, discourse analysis, the meaning of legal texts, and the comprehensibility of jury instructions. Reasons for judicial reluctance to admit linguistic expertise include concerns that it is not sufficiently reliable, the belief that issues like the meaning of a text can just as well be decided by a jury, and sometimes even institutional and political considerations.

The child's task is to reconcile the possible UG options with the positive data provided by the target language. In English, except for the cleft structure, focus is indicated by word stress. I argue that some children initially hypothesize that focus is signaled by syntactic movement. The empirical evidence in favor of this argument comes from a longitudinal diary data from one child, A.L., from age 1;9 to 2;4. In contexts in which the subject of the sentence receives either contrastive or emphatic focus, A.L. produces utterances like ``You're do it,'' or ``I'm do it.'' The nominative pronoun and an agreeing form of be are claimed to be moved to a position of focus in the phrase structure. Further, the first-person utterances like ``I'm do it'' are preceded by utterances with the form ``My do it'' in the same contexts. This leads to the proposal that my is a metathesized form of I'm, not a genitive pronoun as claimed in previous literature. As a consequence, subjects bearing genitive case are claimed not to exist in child English.},

The child went through a protracted stage in which many why-questions lacked subject-aux inversion, in contrast to other wh-questions. While this asymmetry has been observed in the previous literature, several new observations also emerged. First, the child permitted focus phrases, topic phrases and subordinate clauses to intervene between why and the subject NP in matrix why-questions with no I to C movement. Second, subject-aux inversion was consistently manifested in long-distance questions with tensed embedded clauses, and in utterances with why that were not information-seeking questions. Based on the pattern of data, it is proposed that some children initially permit why to merge high in the left periphery, in SpecIntP, following a proposal for Italian by Rizzi, L. (2001). On the position ``Int(errogative)'' in the left periphery of the clause. In G. Cinque \& G. Salvi (Eds.), Current studies in Italian syntax (pp. 287-296). Oxford: Elsevier.

Syntax of why-in-situ: Merge into [SpecCP] in the overt syntax. Natural Language and Linguistic Theory, 23, 867-916.), or (ii) as evidence of a universal principle. In the final analysis, the parameter account is preferred, because it explains the individual variation and the sharp transition to the adult grammar that is observed in some children.},

The semantic dependency that then induces between sentences in discourse is argued to be identical to the depnedency that holds within sentences in temporal adjunct clause constructions. In order to explain how the menaing of then differs depending on its position, I claim that then associates different times in tense structure depending on its syntactic position, resulting in different interpretations. This analysis accounts for interpretive parallels between discourse sequences with then and temporal adjunct clauses, and it predicts the interaction of temporal then with perfect tenses, future readings of present tense, and infinitival clause constructions.},

  volume = {24},
  abstract = {The representation of agreement is a crucial aspect of current syntactic theory, and therefore should apply in both signed and spoken languages. Neidle et al. (2000) claim that all verb types in American Sign Language (agreeing, spatial, and plain) can occur with abstract syntactic agreement for subject and object. On this view, abstract agreement can be marked with either manual agreement morphology (verb directed toward locations associated with the subject/object) or non-manual agreement (eye gaze toward the object/head tilt toward the subject). Non-manual agreement is claimed to function independently as a feature-checking mechanism since it can occur with plain verbs not marked with overt morphological agreement. We conducted a language production experiment using head-mounted eye-tracking to directly measure signers' eye gaze. The results were inconsistent with Neidle et al.'s claims. While eye gaze accompanying (manually/morphologically) agreeing verbs was most frequently directed toward the location of the syntactic object, eye gaze accompanying plain verbs was rarely directed toward the object. Further, eye gaze accompanying spatial verbs was toward the locative argument, rather than toward the object of transitive verbs or the subject of intransitive verbs as predicted by Neidle et al. Additionally, we found a consistent difference in the height of directed eye gaze between spatial and agreeing verbs. Gaze was directed lower in signing space for locative marking than for object marking, thus clearly distinguishing these two argument types. Plain verbs occurring with null object pronouns were not marked by gaze toward the location of the object and always occurred with an overt object topic. Thus, Neidle et al.'s analysis of null objects as licensed by agreement (manual or non-manual) was not supported. Rather, the data substantiated Lillo-Martin's (1986) claim that null arguments for plain verbs are licensed by topics. To account for the observed patterns of eye gaze, we propose an analysis of eye gaze agreement for agreeing and spatial verbs as marking the `lowest' available argument on a noun phrase accessibility hierarchy.},

This analysis explains the syntactic behavior of the ambiguous adverb quickly. In addition, it follows from the analysis that durative adjuncts are adjoined to VP, while time frame adjuncts are adjoined to AspP. Constructions involving preposition stranding, scope of only, parasitic gaps, and semantic restrictions on adjunct PP objects support this approach.},

The idea that clitic climbing involves Io raising with coindexing effects is present in Kayne (1989). In this work we argue that it is To in particular that undergoes raising and support this claim with evidence from Salentino and Serbo-Croation, both of which are languages that lack infinitives but manifest clitic climbing out of finite restructuring contexts inflected for Tense.

Assuming that the Linear Correspondence Axiom does not apply after spell-out, we argue that To serves as a host of clitics when Tense features are weak; as for the remaining contexts, we propose that clitics adjoine to heads that are placeholders, departing from the idea that there is a designated functional head and that clitics adjoin to it in all syntactic environments. We present evidence from Greek dialects which supports theses claims and instantiates the different manner in which clitics combine in clusters.

These predicates restrict their experiencer subjects to first person in the declarative and second person in the interrogative; the restriction is lifted by clausal or lexical evidential markers; and the binding domain for the long-distance anaphor jibun is the same as the evidential domains that lift the person constraint. Most of these facts are not new in the literature, but this proposal to integrate these facts under one general account at the syntax/semantics/discourse interface is new. The paper proposes an integrated account of these facts in the context of a framework for a Syntax of Sentience, which includes sentience roles, functional projections relating to sentience, and morphosyntactic features encoding sentience properties. Each of these separate parts of the proposal arises independently out of a different thread of research. The fact that the syntax of sentience outlined here integrates such a range of facts and literatures is seen as a strength of the approach.},

While it must be admitted that the phenomenon under consideration is by no means confined to Persian, its examination in this language will reveal certain characteristics which are likely to contribute to a better understanding of how temporal deixis, together with aspectual and modal meanings, interact with contextual factors to yield socio-culturally relevant utterances. Of special theoretical interest in this respect are the semantic-pragmatic constraints levied, in varying degrees, on the projected tense in terms of negation, pronominal choice, speech act assignment, aspectual character, modal status, and pitch contour. Fundamental to the present study are three assumptions. First, the deictic projection at issue has pragmatic motivations, and, in addition, stems largely from the ontological asymmetry between pastness and futurity. Second, it has an indisputable edge over the other future-indicating devices available to Persian speakers in that it denotes factivity with respect to the occurrence of a situation. And third, it is stylistically marked as it digresses from the normal function of the past tense.},

Furthermore, I argue that Chinese has some gapping sentences that result from ATB movement from V to v (LPD). This paper identifies two types of gpaping natural languages: gapping derived by V-to-T movmeent and gapping derived to V-to-v movement. Consequently, gapping should not be an 'all or nothing' phenomenon. The data from Chinese affirm Johnson' (1994) theory of gapping that gapping occurs in those languages only with verb movement.},

  volume = {16},
  abstract = {The present study conducted four experiments to investigate how modality information provided through the sentence-final particles -yo and -ne were utilized in identifying an empty subject by native Japanese speakers. Experiment 1 conducted a whole-sentence anomaly decision task, finding that base sentences without -yo and -ne attached were processed more quickly than sentences with either -yo or -ne and that sentences with -yo were processed more quickly than the same sentences with -ne. A delay in processing sentences with -ne was created by the ambiguity of an empty subject identified by -ne as either `I' or `you'. In Experiment 2, the auxiliary verb -ou `let us' was added to the base sentence before -yo and -ne, providing a cue to identify the empty subject as `we'. Although the base sentences were processed more quickly than those containing the particles -yo and -ne, no other difference resulted from the attachment of these particles. To eliminate the possibility of orthographic-length effects, Experiment 3 compared base sentences with -ou, -ou-yo, and -ou-ne, finding no difference among them (i.e., no orthographic-length effects). Experiment 4 was conducted to further eliminate the possible involvement of discourse-level computation by utilizing base sentences with overt subjects, past tense verbs, and the auxiliary verb -rasii `appear to'. Once subjects of sentences were clearly shown, there was no difference among base sentences and those with either -yo or -ne attached (i.e., no discourse-level computation effects). Thus the present study proved that the modality information inherent in the particles -yo and -ne was used for identifying empty subjects.},

  volume = {18},
  abstract = {One of the important topics in current syntactic theory is whether there is a directionality parameter in Universal Grammar. Based on the observation that the presence of Chinese sentence-final aspectual particles blocks movement out of their complement, Lin (Complement-to-Specifier movement in Mandarin Chinese. MS., National Tsing Hua University, 2006) argues that each of these particles is the head of an underlyingly head-initial phrase and that the surface head-final order is derived by movement of its complement. Thus, movement out of it violates the Condition on Extraction Domain [CED: Huang (Logical relations in Chinese and the theory of grammar. PhD dissertation, MIT, 1982)]. Taking this analysis as a diagnostic that distinguishes a derived head-final structure from a genuine one, this paper illustrates that it is not the case that Japanese head-final structures are derived from head-initial ones. Our result implies that Universal Grammar is equipped with a directionality parameter, admitting not only head-initial structures but also head- final structures.},

It is shown that both English and Japanese have short scrambling (i.e., scrambling to VP), whereas only Japanese has longer scrambling as well. On the basis of detailed examination of double complement constructions in the two languages, it is argued that English has a kind of overt object shift that moves an accusative DP within VP rather than to a VP-external position where its Case is to be checked, and that this 'partial' object shift results from short scrambling, analyzed as optional, non-feature-checking movement. It is also shown that the obligatoriness of partial object shift in English can be explained in a principled manner in terms of Attract-F and convergence. This proposal not only has important consequences and implications for certain related theoretical and empirical domains, but also provides significant insights into the nature of scrambling and the theory of parametric variation.},

Two or more elements of a sentence, excluding the verb, can appear rather freely in the focus position of Japanese cleft constructions. These elements cannot possibly be considered to form a base-generated constituent and hence the existence of such ``surprising constituents'' poses an interesting problem for syntactic theory. It is shown that an approach that appeals to overt verb raising to account for surprising constituents is inadequate for a number of reasons. An alternative approach is proposed in which surprising constituents are formed by ``oblique movement'' (movement of an element to another element that does not dominate it). Consequences of this proposal are explored for related theoretical and empirical domains.},

Related issues are also addressed, including those concerning the case, LF position, and thematic properties of the nominative object.

This is clearly different from the behavior of other quantifiers (e.g., universal quantifiers). This paper argues that this scope puzzle is due to a more complex internal structure of comparative quantifiers than other quantifiers. In the decompositional approach that I pursue, comparative quantifiers are decomposed into two generalized quantifiers (i.e., in the case above, the comparative operator er than three and the DP many books). In this approach, obligatory narrow scope of comparative quantifiers in object position is a consequence of the interplay of the independently motivated principles of grammar that also con- strain other quantifiers. On the basis of the scope puzzle, I specifically argue for two constraints on Scope Shifting Operations (SSOs): a locality condition on SSOs and Scope Economy, proposed by Fox (2000), which prohibits SSOs that have no effect on semantic interpretation. Thus, I argue that the apparently peculiar facts of comparative quantifiers are, in fact, additional evidence for the core properties of SSOs.},

We argue that bare nominals in these constructions refer to capacities: professions, religions, nationalities or other roles in society. Capacities are analyzed as entities of type e, sortally distinct from regular individuals as well as kinds. We further argue that the capacity interpretation is associated withNP\textemdash{}alayer within theDP that lacks number features. This accounts for the number-neutral status of bare nominals.

  abstract = {I argue in this paper for a novel analysis of case in Icelandic, with implications for case theory in general. I argue that structual case is the manifestation on the noun phrase of features which are semantically interpretable on verbal projections. Thus, Icelandic case does not encode features of noun phrase interpretation, but it is not uninterpretable either; case is properly seen as reflecting (interpretable) tense, aspect, or Aktionsart features. Accusative case in Icelandic is available when the two subevents introduced in a transitive verb phrase are temporally identified with each other, and dative case is available when the two parts are distinct. This analysis bears directly on the theory of reature checking in teh Minimalist Program. specifically, it is consistent with a restrictive theory of feature checking in which no features are strictly uninterpretable: all formal features come in interpretable-uninterpretable pairs, and feature checking is the matching of such paires, driven by legibility conditions at Spell-Out.},

  volume = {7},
  abstract = {Recent studies of the Modern Mandarin aspectual zhe have found that as an imperfective marker it typically signals a stative resultant situation. In various modern Chinese dialects, the cognates of zhe, however, can also mark perfect, perfective, inchoative, and progressive aspects, as well as locative. By examining various uses of zhe's cognates in modern Chinese langauges and in historical texts, this paper finds that the imperfective zhe may arise from its uses as a directive verb in Middle Chinese. Furthermore, the imperfective and perfect aspects in Modern Wu are used interchangeably in situations related to resultative senses. It is further hypothesized that it is this type of sematnic overlapping that provides important links leading to the genesis of the various aspectual meanings of zhe's cognates. The paper concludes the genesis of the various aspectual meanings of zhe's cognates. The paper concludes that there are no clear-cut semantic boundaries among the Chinese apsectual categories.},

After summarizing the properties of Clitic Left Dislocations (CLLD), I briefly discuss the movement and the base-generation hypotheses for the LD constituent. I also point out the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. I derive the examples of CLLD with and without epithets by merging the LD phrase directly into TopP while accounting for connectivity effects and select island sensitivity through long distance agreement between the CL and TopP. Finally, I show that the proposal explains the properties of both subtypes of CLLD constructions without the disadvantages of previous accounts.},

This solution is here shown to be unworkable: on the one hand, certain double plurals derive from forms with transparently plural morphology; moreover double plurals counterexemplify the Elsewhere Condition even if they are assumed to derive from basic collectives, since the latter are not distinct in their morphosyntactic feature content from ordinary plurals. Plural diminutives present similar difficulties, since their formation requires the successive appliation of two rules whose application is predicted by the Elsewhere Condition to be disjunctive. Besides suggesting that the Elsewhere Condition cannot be maintained in its strongest form, the Breton evidence raises questions about the existence of a strict division between inflectional and derivational morphology.},

Here, Borsley and Stephens' claims are evaluated: it is shown that contrary to their first claim, the Complementarity Principle is a valid generalization for most if not all varieties of Breton; and while the truth of their second claim is acknowledged, it is nevertheless shown that the two principal claims embodied in the 1984 analysis can be maintained in a simle revision of that analysis. The revised account is shown to be fully consistent with the evidence cited by Borsley and Stephens, and is contrasted with the alternative analysis of Breton agreement proposed by Hendrick (1988).},

Although heteroclisis is widely observable, its implications for grammatical theory remain underexplored, perhaps because its canonical instances have the appearance of sporadic lexical exceptions. But heteroclisis cannot be assumed to lack any role in the definition of a language's morphology, since (i) it is sometimes highly systematic, involving whole classes of lexemes, and (ii) it obeys a universal constraint. These two facts show that heteroclisis is rulegoverned. On the assumption that inflectional morphology involves a linkage of content-paradigms with form-paradigms (Stump 2002), heteroclisis can be seen as a kind of mismatch regulated by rules of paradigm linkage. Such rules account for the range of empirical phenomena subsumed by observations (i) and (ii).},

McCloskey (1984) argues that the Irish raising construction involves NP-movement to a VP-internal position, contrary to the Projection Principle. The new analysis proposed here claims that it really involves movement (of an inherently Case-marked NP) to subject position, and thus poses no problem for the Projection Principle. However, this analysis does pose a direct challenge to the Uniformity Condition, since it involves a verb assigning inherent Case to an NP that it does not theta-mark. The paper proposes a new theory of inherent Case assignment that allows for the possibility of the Irish construction, but is sufficiently restrictive so as to account for the rarity of nonthematic inherent Case assignment.},

This view contrasts with the assumption in the second approach that all arguments of the base verb are inherited by the nominal unless they are explicitly bound, but that internal arguments of the noun/nominal are optional (e.g., Bierwisch 1989). The first approach predicates noun-verb asymmetries in argument linking for the class of non-event nominals, while the second approach predicts that the argument linking of nouns/nominals differs from that of verbs in general. Classical Nahuatl, an Uto-Aztecan language, provides evidence against both approaches: in all classes of nominals (event, agent, instrument, locative, and internal argument nominals), unspecific affixes aturate arguments in the base verbs and the derived nominals, independent of whether an event reading is possible or not. Only under the assumption of obligatory argument inheritance can the distribution of active and inactive stems and the distribution of reflexives be explained for the nominals. I will show that none of hte nominals fall under the notion of 'mixed categories' (such as English gerunds), which are expected to display a verb-like argument linking.},

The respective Mayan languages differ in the morphosyntactic implementation of agent focus, i.e. the agreement patterns, the marking of the internal argument and the contexts in which agent focus occurs. The goal of this paper is to provide a lexical approach that accounts for the cross-Mayan variation by means of a small set of faithfulness and markedness constraints. It is proposed that the agent focus marker emerged as a means of disambiguation (by Bidirectional Optimization) and was grammaticalized, thus extending it to contexts where it is not needed and is even counterproductive in terms of the visibility of the arguments' /-features (person and number).},

The main thesis is that these readings result from different ways of inserting logical operators at the level of Logical Form. The basic operator considered here is a cumulative mapping from predicates that apply to singularities onto the corresponding predicates that apply to pluralities. Given a theory which allows for free insertion of such operators, it can then be shown that the lexical semantics of the reciprocal expressions each other/one another consists of exactly two components, namely an anaphoric variable and a non-identity statement. Thsi receives further support from the observation that it is exactly these two components that can be focused by only; all that remains to be done is to correctly manipulate these components at the level of LF.},

  abstract = {This article has two major foci. The first concerns the `cartography' of structural placement of wh-adjuncts how and why, a somewhat elusive and murky issue in modern syntactic research. The non-trivial character of this issue becomes clear once it is realized that each of these items encodes more than one lexical entry in some languages, and, furthermore, different lexical entries display different syntactic distribution. One goal is then to characterize the syntactic distribution of how and why controlling for their different cross-linguistic varieties. Once the ``cartographical'' issue is clarified, a number of novel questions arise concerning the mode of licensing of different varieties of how and why. This brings us to the second, theoretical, focus of the paper: a proper mechanism for licensing wh-in situ, and, in a broader sense, wh-items lower than CP. On the basis of diverse cross-linguistic material, we provide a number of arguments strengthening the Unselective Binding approach to licensing wh-in situ and show how potential challenges can be met in a revealing and explanatory manner.},

The existence of such languages calls into question the unifying basis for the traditional accounts\textemdash{}namely, the complement/noncomplement distinction that was at the core of these accounts. In this paper I consider a possible extension of a recent minimalist account making use of the complement/noncomplement distinction\textemdash{} Nunes and Uriagereka (2000)\textemdash{}to the problematic languages and show that it also encounters conceptual and empirical problems. I then propose an eclectic minimalist approach to extraction domains in which extractability out of subjects and adjuncts are regulated by different mechanisms of grammar in a nonoverlapping manner.},

However, some data turn out to be problematic for the traditional account. The alternative considered here involves pied-piping at an intermediate level between S-structure and LF. It is called WH-structure and is followed by reconstruction at LF. This proposal will combine the essential insights of Nishigauchi's idea and have all its advantages over the traditional view, without running into the problems of his approach.},

Sui adjective intensifiers show evidence of partial reduplication involving a complex interplay of morpho-phonological processes: rhyme, alliteration, The Emergence of The Unmarked (TETU), and identity avoidance patterns that support Kennard's ``Copy but don't repeat'' [(2004). Phonology, 21(3), 303\textendash{}323]. This Sui phenomenon has never been reported to the wider linguistic community beyond Guizhou, and it provides valu- able theoretical insight into reduplication and related morpho-phonological pro- cesses. Moreover, the interaction of these morpho-phonological processes forms a system of patterned variety that may be viewed as a poeticized lexicon or lexicalized poetry, thus illustrating the presence of extensive poetic effects embedded within the core grammar. In this way, Sui provides strong support for Yip's observation that ``humans have both an aptitude and a taste for creating repetitive sequences, and they may use this skill in a variety of ways that are more or less part of the core grammar of the language'' [(1999).

In these grammars, all linguistic variation is lexical: constituent order is determined by lexical functional elements, and structure building operations are universal. Given universal constraints on the category system, these grammars can be identified in the limit from a positive text of derived structures, where these structures contain no fatures except the pronounced, phonetic elements. Identification from pronounced strings alone is shown to be impossible. In the light of this last negative result and related problems, rather than assuming that the learner somehow determines constituent structure from prosodic and semantic cues, an alternative approach to the learning problem is proposed.},

It is shown that Hindi, in fact, has two types of relative clauses which are syntactically and semantically distinct. Hindi embedded and right-adjoined relative clauses are generaqted inside NP and function like noun modifiers. They are similar in essential respects to restrictive relative clauses in English. Hindi left-adjoined relative clauses, on the other hand, are adjoined to IP at D-structure. They do not function like noun modifiers but are quantificational expressions binding variables inside their scope domain. It is suggested that left-adjoined relatives belong typologically with free relatives in English and internally-headed relatives in Quechua, since they have certain significant properties in common with these constructions.},

Although only French is discussed here in any detail, such a split seems to have much wider relevance, in other Romance languages, in some Germanic and Scandinavian languages, and beyond (Wolof). This split in turn shows that the que/qui rule (and its cognates) should be looked at differently\textemdash{}in particular, that they should be uncoupled from constraints on subject extraction.},

A growing number of recent workson predicate decomposition have shown that there is a close correlation between the semantics of event structure and the syntax (e.g. Hale \& Keyser 1993, Harley 1995, Travis 2000, van Hout 2000, Ramchand 2003, 2007). Thisarticle presentsan additional empirical argument for the view that there isa direct mapping between semantic decomposition of predicates and the (morpho)syntax by developing an explicit analysis of the semantics and syntax of the verbal suffix -kan in Standard Indonesian. We argue that -kan isa morphological reflex of the RESULT head, the semantics of which givesris e to a causative interpretation. By treating -kan as being sensitive to a syntactic configuration involving a result state, the current analysis not only provides important empirical support for the event decomposition of predicates in the syntax but also leads to a unified semantic and syntactic account of -kan, which captures straightforwardly distributional properties of the suffix.},

By analysing the much-discussed plural morphology of Standard German by means of both prosodic as well as morphological principles, it is argued that final schwa in plural nouns of Standard German is not, as generally assumed, an inflectional suffix. As an alternative, an optimality-theoretic constraint-based analysis of final schwa in plurals leads to the proposal that this segment in noun plurals of Standard German arises as an inserted vowel, which is in turn the result of a specific constraint interaction. In the second part of this paper, related noun plurals are studied in a sample of diverse non-standard dialects of German. Morphological and prosodic constraints, through the well-known mechanism of differences in constraint-ranking in Optimality Theory, derive the (non-)appearance of word-final plural schwas in these dialects which are minimally different from Standard German and from each other. The constraints will include those which refer to properties of whole paradigms of word forms, not just to phonological properties of individual words. As an overall descriptive result, a micro-typology of plural formation in varieties of German emerges, and the prosodic phonology of German is demonstrated to play a crucial role in the formation of word forms.},

The rationale clause is related to the matrix in two important ways: the null subject ofthe inifintive (PRO) is usually coreferential iwth a phrase in teh matrix (control), and the intention it expresses is ususally assigned to a phrase in teh matrix (predication). Given the controller and argument of the rationale clause are usually clausemates of the infinitive itself, the strongest hypothesis is that both control and predication are strictly local. however, there has been much debate in teh literature concerning the viability of such a locality constraint. In this article, I argue in favou of a locality-based account of control and predication in the rationale clause, comparing it with a discourse-semantic constraint approach and a logophoricity constraint approach. Data from two related modifier infinitives (the "purpose clause" and the "telic clause") will be used to sharpen the discussion.},

The literature on the subject of nasality distinguishes between nasal vowels, nasalized vowels, and nasal diphthongs. In agreement with earlier proposals it is argued that nasal vowels derive synchronically from underlying sequences of a vowel followed by a nasal mora. The discussion of nasalized vowels concentrates on the behavior of the palatal nasal /n/. Allophonic nasalization caused by /n/ seems to function in a way comparable with (surface) constrastive nasalization triggered by the nasal mora. This effect is explained as a consequence of the fact that palatal sonarants are represented as phonological geminates. The phonology of nasal diphthongs will also be discussed, and it will be shown that they are not derived from an oral diphthong followed by a nasal mora, as is generally assumed, but are represented as nasal diphthongs at the level of lexical representation.},

Focusing on NOR-2, we will show that the choice of word order (V2 or V3) is dependent on the information status of the subject.

Furthermore, based on the split-CP analysis we will account for the word order differences in the three Norwegian dialect types by postulating a parameterized requirement for filling different C heads. The analysis proposed will also account for why the complementizer $\backslash$emphsom is inserted in NOR-2 and NOR-3 whenever the wh-constituent is the subject of the clause. In addition, on the basis of a comparison with Norwegian we will provide analysis of the English subject/oblique asymmetry in wh-questions, i.e., of the fact that there is no auxiliary inversion/do-support in main clause subject wh-questions.},

The argument is based on the nature of the variation and te frequencies with which the different wh-questions are attested in typical child-directed speech. The paper takes a microparametric approach to V2 which assumes the existence of many V2 grammars, differeing from each other with respect to informaiton structure and the status of the various wh-elements. These grammars are learnable because children are sensitive to minor but linguistically relevant distinctions in the acquisition process. Nevertheless, certain distinctions are vulnerable to change if the corresponding cues are expressed in the children's input with a very low frequency. On this perspective, gradual historical development may be considered to be the result of many small I-language changes in succession.},

The Non- Disparity Principle requires that a modal sentence does not make distinctions on the basis of facts settled at speech time. Selection of the modal base will set these principles against each other, or allow for their cooperative interaction. For a root modal base, there is a conflict and disparity wins. The resulting interpretation is future. For a non-root modal base, the principles cooperate. Non-disparity determines a non-future interpretation and disparity requires the sentence to go beyond what is known by the speaker.},

In a dialect of Yemeni Arabic, emphasis has two articulatory correlates, pharyngealization and labialization: within the phonological word, pharyngealization spreads predominantly leftward, and labialization spreads rightward, targeting short high vowels. Since asymmetries in the directionality of spread of a secondary feature are phonetically motivated and depend on whether the feature is anchored to the onset or the release phase of the primary articulation, it is arged that the unmarked directionality of spread should be encoded in the phonology as a markedness statement on that feature.},

Watson \& Gibson (2004a) proposed that the likelihood of an intonational boundary at a word boundary is a function of 1) the size of the most recently completed constituent and 2) the size of the upcoming constituent if it is not an argument of the most recent head. We explore an alternate hypothesis to (1): the distance of integration between an upcoming word and its attachment site in the sentence influences the likelihood of an intonational boundary. In a production experiment (Experiment 1), we found that speakers intonational phrasing patterns were consistent with Watson \& Gibson's original hypothesis. We then present two studies of sentence comprehension using converging paradigms which test the hypothesis that listeners exploit the relationship between syntax and the production-based intonational boundaries by using a special parsing heuristic. In particular, we propose that listeners prefer not to attach incoming words to lexical heads that are followed by an intonational boundary. This hypothesis is validated in both Experiments 2 and 3.},

Although English resultatives naturally divide into transitive and intransitive resultatives (in the sense of Carrier and Randall (1992)), and intransitive resultatives are systematically missing from Japanese, it is not exactly this distinction that demarcates the English set and teh Japanese set since Japanese permits only certain types of transitive resultatives, rejecting other types that would be possible in English. Languages like French are essentially like Japanese in this respect. Thus, the category "transitive resultatives" needs to be divided into at least two types (called here WEAK and STRONG resultatives), and there is a natural class of resultatives comprising strong transitive resultatives and all intransitive resultatives, the latter being always "strong" by the definition of this notion given in this paper. Certain examples that bear a superficial resemblance to resultatives (called here SPURIOUS resultatives) are also discussed and shown to constitute a different phenomenon.

Moreover, the use of a derferred equative requires the presence of a contextually licensed open proposition whose instantiation encodes the particular mapping between entities, both of which remain accessible to varying degrees within the discourse model.

  volume = {12},
  abstract = {One of the fundamental goals of every phonological theory is to account for the nature of the basic units of speech sounds, and the relationships between these units and their contextual variants. This relationship is equally crucial to the phonological theory whether it is called 'phonemes and allophones', 'unerlying and surface forms', or 'input and output'. However, purely structural analyses of phonological systems can often produce several hypotheses regarding the phonemic inventory and its surface reflexes in any particular language, all of which are supportable by the contrast and alternation patterns of the languages. In this paper we look at four such hypotheses regarding the underlying vowel system of Mandarin, all based on Beijin Mandarin: the six-vowel system of c. Cheng (1973), the five-vowel systems of R. Cheng (1966) and of Lin(1989), and the four-vowel system of Wu (1994). We then present distributiona, phonetic, and psycholinguistic evdence (the latter based on a corpus of 238 syntagmatic speech errors or 'slips of the tongue' involving vowels) that the vowel system of the dialect of Mandarin currently spoken in Taiwan cannot be accounted for by any ofhtese hypotheses. We then propose a new 5-vowel system for Taiwan Mandarin, based ont eh distributional, phonetic, and especially the psycholinguistic facts. We conclude that phonological theories which are compatible with psycholinguistic evidence such as the data presented here are those most likely to be modeling the actual cognitive representations and processes of real speakers.},

This paper examines round harmony in Classical Manchu and Oroquen, where round spreading occurs only when the first two syllables of a word are round, that is, it requires a bisyllabic trigger (Zhang 1996). It is argued that the binary threshold emerges from conflict betwen well-established phonological demands \textendash{} numeric reference is neither necessary nor desirable. The study isloates two distinct restrictions on rounding in bisyllabic trigger languges: initial round licensing and round spreading \textendash{} requirements occurring independently in Classical Mongolian and Ulcha. Separating these restctions is key: each is active in conflicting constraint that restricts features to a tautosyllabic domain. Ranking the tautosyllabic constraint between round licensing and spreading prevents cross-syllable spreading except when violations of tautosyllabicity are independently necessitated by round licensing. As a result, spreading is initiated only when the first two syllables are round. Implications are identified for the characterization of faithfulness. Positional faithfulness constraints play a key role in realizing the privileged status of the root-initial syllable in round licenisng and harmony. In addition, the analysis supports the sparation of Ident(F) into IO and OI constraints, which distinguish between the loss and gain of privative features specifications, respectively. the distinction proves essential in the case of bisyllabic triggers. The constraint interaction that produces the two-syllable trigger threshold is instance of a general phenomenon explored here, termed Parasitic Constraint Satisfaction. This kind of interaction arises when there are two constraints or constraint sets, a and b, whose satisfaction each necessitates violating a constraint, g, and they are ranked a$>>$g$>>$b. When satisfaction of a compels violations of g that also permit satisfaction of b, then b is described as parasitic on a. Two outcomes for Parasitic Constraint Satisfaction are discussed. The first is an emergence of the unmarked, occurring when b is a markedness constraint whose activity emerges in contexts where it is parasitic on a. The second outcome, where b is a faithfulness constraint, si an emergence of the faithful.},

Height harmony in Veneto Italian dialects, wherein a post-tonic high vowel triggers raising of preceding mid vowels, forms a case study. Veneto presents two variable patterns: stress-targeted harmony, in which harmony propagates to the stressed syllable, and maximal extension harmony, in which raising persists to pretonic vowels. The conditions under which weak vowels trigger and control harmony are examined. It is argued that weak trigger harmony is motivated by perceptual dis- advantage: harmony improves exposure of the spreading feature, accomplished either by extending to a stressed position or maximizing duration in the word. The apparent primacy of the vowel quality in weak position in Veneto is accounted for by markedness factors that independently prevent the stressed vowel from overriding it. In regard to positional privilege, it is argued that positional licensing (markedness) drives stress-targeted spreading \textendash{} positional faithfulness cannot be responsible for strong targets. A weak trigger pattern emerges when licensing constraints operating over perceptually marked structure dominate positional faithfulness. Crosslinguistic applications are also explored.},

This paper looks at the distributional pattern of NPIs under `only' and presents evidence for the movement theory of focus association and against an in situ approach. NPIs are licensed in the `scope' (or the second argument) of `only', but not in the complement (or its first argument), which I will call the `syntactic restrictor'. While earlier approaches argued that `only' licenses NPIs in the unfocused part of the sentence it occurs in except in its focus, evidence from DP-`only' shows that NPIs are also not licensed in the unfocused part of the syntactic restrictor. The distribution of NPIs provides a test for the size of the syntactic restrictor, and this test is applied to the case of VP-`only'. The evidence shows that (i) the restrictor can be smaller than the entire VP and is not necessarily identical to the surface complement of `only'; (ii) in the case of association with a head the restrictor comprises an XP containing the head; and (iii) in cases of association into an island, the restrictor comprises the entire island. Generalizations (i)\textendash{}(iii) can be captured straightforwardly by a movement approach but are incompatible with an in situ analysis. Contextual domain restriction of the kind used in in situ approaches accounts for the appropriate semantics in cases where the semantic focus is properly contained in the syntactic restrictor of `only'.},

A systematic relation between the semantics, the syntactic combinatorics, and the prosodic phrasing of coordinate structures can be captured by recursively building up their prosody, in tandem with assembling their compositional meaning. Alternative edge-based approaches to prosodic phrasing fail to capture the recursive nature of the generalization, a result independent of whether or not prosodic representation itself is assumed to be recursive. The pattern generalizes beyond the grammar of coordination, despite two types of apparent counterexamples: Structures that are prosodically flat but syntactically articulated, and structures with an apparent outright mismatch between prosody and syntax. Closer inspection suggests that the syntax might actually be quite in tune with prosody. In both cases, natural language employs strategies to construe complex meaning with list-like structures rather than nested ones. The privileged status of lists may be due to processing factors.},

  volume = {9},
  abstract = {This article discusses the phenomenon of pied-piping in restrictive relative clauses in the Germanic languages Dutch, German, and English. Since it concerns possessive relatives primarily, an integrated approach to the syntax of relativization and attributive possession is sought for. Possessive relatives directly reflect the three basic types of attributive possession, namely, the prepositional, the genitive, and the possessive pronoun construction. It is claimed that the promotion theory of relative clauses can be successfully combined with an analysis of possession in which the prepositional construction is taken to be the basis for the other types. Furthermore, it is shown that heavy pied-piping is normally dependent on the presence of a prepositional phrase. In general, pied-piping is claimed to be a possible consequence of overt or covert head movement. Finally, the effect of the so-called R-transformation on pied-piping and preposition stranding in relative clauses is discussed. The different possibilities shown by English, Dutch, and German are argued to be consequences of the theoretical possibilities of creating a syntactic relation, namely, by XP movement, overt head movement, or covert movement.},

  volume = {14},
  abstract = {This article describes a variety of intonation patterns in Central Catalan and examines the process of tonal realization of these tunes over short sequences, namely, monosyllabic phrases and utterances containing just one stressed syl- lable. When faced with multiple association, Catalan displays at least three different procedures to adapt intonational contours: when the tune is composed of one pitch accent plus a boundary tone sequence, the general strategy used by this language is compression; by contrast, when the tune is made out of two pitch accents plus an edge tone sequence the solution is either to delete (or fail to associate) the first pitch accent (a process which could be understood as tune truncation) or the second one. The contrast between compression and deletion strategies falls out directly from an autosegmental view of intonational contours: since a given metrically strong position cannot bear more than one pitch accent, compression is thus ruled out when melodic tunes contain a minimum of two pitch accents. The contrast between the failure to link the first or the second pitch accent, though, cannot be easily predicted if we follow standard autosegmental assumptions: since this framework assumes that all of the pitch accents have the same status, it offers no way to predict which pitch accent is going to associate to the text. The main goal of this article is to explore the implications of the Catalan compression data for the theory of tune-text association and the structure of pitch contours and to propose ways to modify standard autosegmental assumptions to accommodate the different compression strategies displayed by Catalan. It will be argued that the most convincing way to account for such contrasts has to rely on the postulation of a hierarchical structure for such tunes.},

  title = {Immobile {{Complex Verbs}} in {{Germanic}}},
  volume = {8},
  abstract = {Certain complex verbs in Dutch, German, and Swiss German do not undergo verb movement. The suggestion to be made in this article is that these ``immobile'' verbs have to fulfill both the requiremetns imposed on complex verbs of the V type (=verbs with non-separable prefixes) and the requirements imposed on complex verbs of the V* ytpe (=verbs with spearable prefixes). This results in such verbs being morphologically unexceptional, 9.e., having a full set of forms but syntactically peculiar (``immobile''), i.e., they can only occur in their base position. Any movement is incompatible with either the V requiremetns or the V* requirements. Haider (1993, p. 62) and Koopman (1995), who also discuss such immobile verbs, only account for verbs with two prefix-like parts (e.g., German $\backslash$emphurauff\"uhren ('to perform (a play) for the first time' or Dutch $\backslash$emphherinvoeren `to introduce'), not for the more frequent type with only one prefix-like part (e.g., German $\backslash$emphbauchreden/Dutch $\backslash$emphbuikspreken `to ventriloquize'). This analysis will try to account not only for the data discussed in Haider (1993) and Koopman (1995) but also for the following: -why immobile verbs include verbs with only one prefix-like part (and why this single prefix-like part may NOT be a particle), -why immobile verbs even include verbs with two prefix-like parts, where each of these are separable particles (as in, e.g., German $\backslash$emphvoranmelden `preregister'), -why there is such a great amount of speaker variation as to which verbs are immobile, -why such verbs are not found in Germanic VO-languages such as English and Scandinavian.},

I provide several arguments showing that clause union properties are licensed in the absence of complex head formation and that complex head formation hence cannot be seen as a condition on clause union/restructuring. Complex head approaches are compared to syntactic complementation approaches\textemdash{}in particular, to an approach where the verbs of a restructuring construction project independent VPs that include all the internal arguments associated with the particular verbs. A series of empirical facts are considered (constituency, word order, modification, event structure properties, and nominalizations) that all point to the conclusion that these constructions involve regular VPs rather than complex V-V heads. Although it is not excluded that complex head approaches could be adjusted to accommodate these facts, the main advantage of the VP-complementation approach is that the sum of the properties discussed follows without additional assumptions from the structure suggested and that this approach also correctly predicts which constructions are excluded.},

In truth-conditional accounts, the literal truth of a clause with the modal progressive hinges on the possibility of the described outcome. The clause's truth under such accounts has also been tacitly assumed to describe its felicitous use. Two challenges for this strategy are discussed. First, a progressive clause exhibiting the imperfective paradox can occur felicitously even when the described outcome is not possible. Second, a progressive clause exhibiting the paradox can occur felicitously with an accompanying unless-clause, yet the analysis of unless-clauses directly contradicts the modal analysis of the truth-conditional behavior of the progressive clause in such cases. If the analysis of unless is not flawed, then the modal pro- gressive will require reanalysis.},

  abstract = {This paper provides a new semantics for the perfective le. The perfective le can denote completion, termination and inception. It has context-dependent semantic behaviors: it denotes termination only when completion is canceled, and it cannot go with an activity without an appropriate linguistic context. The Significant Point (SigP) analysis is proposed to account for the different semantics of the perfective le. The SigP of an achievement is its natural final endpoint. The SigP of an accomplishment is, by default, its natural final endpoint. The SigP of an activity is underspecified and an appropriate linguistic context can impose a SigP on an activity. The SigP of a stage-level state is its starting point and the SigP of an individual-level state is undefined. The perfective le is argued to identify the SigP of the predicate it goes with, and to locate the interval from the starting point to the SigP before a reference time. Different SigPs of different situation types result in different readings when predicates of different situation types go with the perfective le. In order to capture the context-dependent semantics of le, this paper argues that, in addition to a compositional semantics, the perfective le is also associated with a set of meaning postulates which specify contextual affects on the semantics of le.},

Given the generally accepted claim of positional faithfulness to the onset (Lombardi, Natural Language and Linguistic Theory 13:39\textendash{}74, 1995; Beckman, Positional faithfulness, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, 1998; Casali, Resolving hiatus, University of California, Los Angeles, 1998), however, the coda saliency effect observed in Korean sonorant assimilation is intriguing. Drawing on a theory of Licensing by Cue and the P-map hypothesis (Steriade, Phonetics in phonology: The case of laryngeal neutralization, UCLA, 1997; Steriade, The phonology of perceptibility effects: The P-map and its consequences for constraint organization, UCLA, 2001), this study claims that coda saliency is a language-specific phonological reflex of the contrast asymmetry in the lexical representation and in acoustic cues. The asymmetry in functional load depending on the position is reflected in the perception of similarity, namely whether the difference between two alveolar sonorants is less distinctive or robust in word-initial vs. word-final position. Based on similarity ranking by reference to the perceptibility difference, this study argues that the marginally contrastive sonorant in the onset is more likely to be the target of neutralization than is the sonorant in the coda, whose contrastiveness is well-grounded in Korean phonology.},

The final endpoint imposed on an activity by past tense is not accessible to the other sentences in the same discourse while the final endpoint imposed by rhetorical relations, such as Narration, is. I argue that this difference results from the fact that in Mandarin tense does not impose a final endpoint until a coherent discourse is formed. I also discuss the implications of this paper for the determination of temporal locations in Mandarin, the status of Tense Phrase (TP) in Mandarin, the semantics of the perfective le, and modeling Mandarin discourse.},

Second, contrary to the usual assumption that UG allows for only one structural Case for objects, there are, in fact, two structural object Cases available in UG: on, termed 'objective Case' here, is assigned/checked in Spec Agr-O and is associated with object agreement, if the langauge has object agreement. There is a limit of one objective Case per clause. The other, termed 'accusative Case' here, is assigned/checked by V inside VP and is never associated with object agreement. There may be more than one structural accusative Case per clause. The third claim is that the following descriptive generalization holds universally: in a clause with a lexically Cased subject (e.g., ergative or dative) the highest object cannot have structural accusative Case (although that object can have objective Case). That generalization and the facts that motivated Burzio's (1986) generalization are manifestations of a broader generalization governing the maximum number of accusative Cases that a verb can assign.},

  abstract = {Despite extensive research over the past several decades, a number of issues concerning the development of AFRICAN AMERICAN VERNACULAR ENGLISH (AAVE) remain unresolved. These include the regional accommodation of earlier African American speech; the sources of its current, distinctive structural features; and the past and present trajectory of change. To address these questions, this study examines several longstanding, isolated biracial sociolinguistic situations in the coastal and the Appalachian regions of North Carolina. One of these situations involves a core community of African Americans, whereas two of the situations involve case studies of isolated speakers. A comparison of diagnostic phonological and morphosyntactic variables for speakers representing different generations of African Americans and baseline European American speakers suggests that extensive accommodation to localized dialects characterized earlier African American speech. At the same time, the maintenance of an exclusive subset of dialect features suggests persistent substrate influence and long-term ethnolinguistic distinctiveness along with local dialect accommodation. Younger African Americans in some historically isolated rural regions appear to be moving away from the localized dialects toward a more generalized AAVE norm.},

Yet in this paper it is argued that the simpler treatment of distributivity using unary universal quantification should be retained. Seemingly polyadic effects are claimed to be restricted to definite NPs. This fact is accounted for by the special anaphoric (dependent) use of definites. Further evidence concerning various plurals, island constraints and cumulative quantification is shown to support this claim. In addition, it is shown that the evidence against a simple atomic version of unary distributivity is not decisive either. In the (uncommon) cases where distributivity which definites is not strictly atomic, they can be analyzed as dependent implicit quantifiers.},

In contrast to most previous approaches to the information structure of VPE (Rooth 1992b, Tomioka 1995, Fox 1998), which claim under a symmetry assumption that the function of VPE is to contrastively focus the remaining subject in relation to the subject in the antecedent clause, I show that in the unmarked case, focus and deaccentuation in the antecedent and the elliptical clause need not be symmetric. I propose a unified account of the informaiton structure of VPE by assuming a single PF economy priniciple, Silent Copy, interacting with a syntactic focus theory which allows for layered focus structures. In particular, Silent Copy favors to leave a syntactic copy unpronounced provided focus is assigned to the head of the sentence internal polarity phrase. The arguements in support of this proposal rest to a substantial degree on a theory of focus in question-answer contexts, as proposed by Drubig (1998). I show that VPE characterized by nonsymmetric focus and deaccentuation occurs as an answer to multiple wh-question giving rise to a presentational focus reading. The symmetric focus and deaccentuation type then falls out as a special case in which the VPE answers a narrowly focusing question.},

In particular, the paper shows that independent pronouns contain a syntactically active determiner, and concludes that they are full DPs with an elliptical NP. Licensing of elliptical NPs is subject to cross-linguistic variation, and thus not all languages allow for determiners to be used pronominally. The analysis of independent pronouns as full DPs is supported by their external syntax as well as their binding properties. It is shown that independent pronouns behave like R-expressions in that they are subject to Condition C. On the basis of this observation, it is concluded that binding theory must be sensitive to syntactic categories, and, crucially, that regular 'condition B' pronouns cannot be analyzed as (intransitive) DPs, contrary to standard assumptions.},

The plural marker in this language displays neither inflectional nor derivational properties. I argue that its distributional properties derive from its syntax: it is a modifier adjoined to category-neutral roots. The analysis implies that plural marking is not universally merged as a syntactic (functional) head and that it does not universally merge with nouns. This leads to the postulation of a new typology of plural marking which goes beyond the distinction between inflectional and non-inflectional plural marking. Several diagnostics to distinguish among distinct types of plural markers are established.},

It will be shown that bare nouns in Dene Suline can be mass or count. Hence, the difference between count and mass cannot be expressed in terms of number, as in Chierchia. Instead, I express it in terms of atomicity. Mass nouns have nonatomic denotations, bare count nouns have atomic denotations that comprise singularities and pluralities. I also propose that numerals contain a function that accesses the singularities in a noun's denotation. Hence they are compatible with bare count nouns, but not with mass nouns. In classifier languages, numerals denote a cardinality only; singularity-accessing functions are expressed in separate elements: the classifiers. Thus, languages like Chinese require classifiers because the numerals are semantically deficient, and not, as is assumed by Chierchia and others, the bare nouns.},

  abstract = {In the context of a subclass of bare complements in Swedish, the present paper argues for a structure of grammar that partly separates the mechanisms that build syntactico-semantic structures from those determining the phonological expression of these. The parasitic supine construction displays the properties that are relevant for such separation: a clear-cut discrepancy between form and meaning. The construction type exemplifies a complementation strategy available for a restricted class of infinitive selecting verbs in variants of the Scandinavian languages. The complement verb surfaces with an inflection identical to that of the matrix verb, yet the form has no effect on the interpretation, which remains the same as for the infinitival counterpart used in the standard language. The approach makes use of grammatical feature underspecification, the seeming gap between meaning and form being bridged by selectional restrictions and constraints on the relevant syntactic configuration. On the basis of its distribution, it is proposed that the phenomenon is a restructuring effect. The form is the result of morphological manipulations of the underspecified syntactico-semantic structure, providing it with the necessary clothes for Vocabulary Insertion.},

Malagasy personal pronouns surface either as independent words or as suffixes, two sets of forms which some properties identify as strong and weak, in C\&S's framework. Further investigation, however, reveals that C\&S's strong/weak distinction, framed in terms of the hierarchical projection of functional categories, only partially captures the properties of Malagasy pronouns. What the Malagasy data suggest is that degrees of deficiency involve different components of linguistic theory. We argue that morphological deficiency, caused by suffixation, is independent from both phonological deficiency (caused by the lack of word-stress) and from syntactic deficiency (caused by the lack of some syntactic projection). Evidence from Malagasy further leads us to conclude, contra C\&S, that syntactic deficiency does not necessarily arise from peeling off the topmost projection in a tree structure.},

In particular, I investigate two syntactic constructions in which an adjective takes scope out of its embedding DP, thus raising an interesting question for strict compositionality. Regarding the first construction, I follow Larson (1999) and assume that the adjective incorporates into the determiner of its DP, forming a complex quantifier [D+A]. I present new evidence in favor of this analysis. Since Larson's semantic analysis of complex quantifiers [D+A] makes a wrong prediction, I propose an alternative, empirically more adequate analysis that treats D+A compounds as pluractional quantifiers in the sense of Lasersohn (1995). Finally, I turn to the second construction, arguing that \textendash{} despite superficial similarities to the first construction - it should not be analyzed in terms of complex quantifier formation, but in terms of LF-movement of the adjective to Spec,DP. The discussion suggests that there is more than one way for DP-internal modifiers to take DP-external scope in natural language.},

  volume = {4},
  abstract = {An optimality-theoretic analysis of third tone sandhi (TS) domains of Mandarin in proposed in preference to other approaches. The constraint-based analysis provides a descriptively better solution to questions such as why it is possible for a preposition to resist tone sandhi in certain structures, a long-standing problem in tone sandhi studies. The paper shows that this resistance to tone sandhi is dependent on both syntactic structures and syntactic categories. In this study, Madnarin tone sandhi domains are related to constituent strength represenations, which are direct mappings of syntactic structures. An unspecified order of strong/weak values of constituent strength for a prepositional phrase is proposed. To define a TS domain, several constraints related to metrical factors, constituent strength, the tone sandhi domain grouping direction, and output condition are shown to interact with each other. The optimal tone sandhi domain represenation is always the one which violates the lowest-ranked constraints and violates any single constraint to the least degree possible, compared to other rrepresentations. The avoidance of tone sandhi by an element, whether it is a preposition or anohter category, is the result of interactions of the constraints. The variability of surface tone patterns comes from more than one optimal output, from speaking rate or style, and from two possible kinds of competition due to the unspecified constitutent strength.},

On the other hand, there is also nominal raising to the left of a repetitive or durative expression, and the raising is optional if an overt verb shows up, and obligatory if there is no overt verb.

An asymmetry exists between the two types of systems: left-dominant sandhi often involves rightward extension of the initial tone to the entire sandhi domain; right-dominant sandhi, however, often involves default insertion and paradigmatic neutralization of nonfinal tones. I argue that the extension of a tone to a larger domain may serve two markedness purposes: the reduction of tonal contours on a syllable and the reduction of pitch differences across syllable boundaries, both of which have a rightward directionality preference. The former is due to the durational advantage afforded by final lengthening; the latter is due to the universal preference for progressive tonal coarticulation. I show that a theory that formally encodes these preferences via intrinsic constraint rankings can predict the directional asymmetry noted above.},

I suggest that the Nguni relative concords are the result of a grammaticalisation process in which early Nguni relative complementisers first turned into clitics and then into relative concords.

Based on data from English, Italian, and Paduan, we examine this question focusing on a less wellstudied clause type, exclamatives. We argue that there is no particular element in syntax responsible for introducing force. Rather, there are two fundamental syntactic components which identify a clause as exclamative, a factive and a WH-operator. These are crucial because they are responsible for two fundamental semantic properties characteristic of exclamatives, namely that they are factive and denote a set of alternative propositions. The force of exclamatives, which we characterize as WIDENING, is derived indirectly, based on the semantic properties.},

  title = {Encoding the {{Addressee}} in {{Syntax}}: {{Evidence}} from {{English Imperative Subjects}}},
  volume = {26},
  abstract = {Imperative subjects in English are puzzling in several respects: null subjects are possible with a definite interpretation, unlike in other clause types; quantificational subjects are often restricted to range over a set containing the addressee and exhibit binding possibilities not readily available to them in declaratives and interrogatives; and third person referential subjects are for most speakers limited to bare noun phrases. On the empirical side, this paper provides a comprehensive discussion of these properties that makes sense of the sometimes contradictory observations found in the literature. On the theoretical side, it argues that the syntactic representation of imperatives contains a functional projection not present in other clause types. This projection plays a role both in preventing the instantiation of a predication relation between the subject and the predicate, and, when sufficiently local, in licensing the special syntactic properties of the subject. This proposal differs from those that view the properties of imperative subjects as deriving uniquely from the semantic or pragmatic component; it can be seen as building on the general intuition of the old performative hypothesis, though recasting it at a level of abstraction that captures more adequately the properties of imperatives.},

The restrictions in question have been analyzed previously as deriving from ``double anchoring'' of the complement tense, both by the matrix event and by utterance time. On the basis of evidence from Spanish and Italian, this article claims that only one of these relations is genuine tense anchoring: anchoring by utterance time. The other relation, ``event anchoring'' is shown to derive from the role of complement constituents in ``measuring out'' the aspect of the matrix predicate. Spanish and Italian provide evidence that the distribution of the DAR correlates with aspectual properties of the matrix predicate. This generalization is argued to derive from the capacity of complement clauses to express a temporal ``Path'' along which a Theme progresses, analogous to Paths expressed by other constituents such as PPs and DPs. Tense anchoring is simplified as a consequence.},

  abstract = {Pluractionality (PLR) is the morphological category that generally signifies multiple actions. This paper, based on original fieldwork, provides the first investigation of PLR in Chechen, a Nakh language spoken in the eastern central part of the North Caucasus. The data reflects the standard dialect of Chechen spoken in and near the cities of Murus-Martan and Grozny. Chechen PLR, which is marked by stem vowel alternations, prototypically signifies the repetition of an event (e.g., saca/sieca `to stop once/many times'; laaca/liica `to catch once/many times'). The plurality of the nominative argument can affect the interpretation of some verbs (e.g., ghitta `to wake up'; hitta `to assume a standing position'), rendering the reading distributive. More interestingly, a durative reading, signaling the prolongation of an event, is available for some verbs (e.g., xouzha/xiizha `to ache momentarily/for a while', zouza/ziiza `to itch momentarily/for a while') but not others. Following Ojeda (1998) and Lasersohn (1995), PLR is accounted for in terms of the pluralization of the event argument of a predicate. The various semantic effects are the results of interactions between the aspectual properties of individual verbs and event pluralization.},

Based on comparative evidence, it is demonstrated that this phonetically aberrant neutralization pattern is the result of a series of phonetically natural sound changes.

  abstract = {In the Pingding dialect of Madarin, the infixing of a retroflex lateral, -l-, before the nucleus marks diminutive. Pingding infixation not only creates onset clusters but also introduces a phoneme. Both features are otherwise not found elsewhere in the language. We argue that the infix -l-, which is cognate with the diminutive -r suffix in other Mandarin dialects, is the result of rhotic metathesis (cf. Blevins and Garrett (1998)). This study shows that Pingding infixation presents an interesting challenge to the theory that claims sound change/metathesis is perceptually optimizing and that it is goal-driven (Hume (1997, 1998, 2001), Steriad (2001)). In this paper, we advance a theory of the origin of Pingding infixation, based on the listener-oriented (i.e., 'innocent') view of sound change (Ohala (1993)), which accounts for the appearance of -l- as an excrescent segment through acoustic means, rather than articulatory (Chen (1992)) or phonotactic ones (Lin (2002)).},

I argue in this paper that the paradoxical properties begin to fall into place once we posit that what undergoes movement in SOR in these languages is not the embedded subject, but the embedded Major Subject. The Major Subject is the initial Nom-marked DP in a Multiple Nominative Construction. It is shown that if we posit that the Major Subject raises in SOR, the unexpected properties of SOR can be accounted for. Under this analysis, SOR in Korean and Japanese conform to known constraints on A-movement taking place from the highest A-specifier (Major Subject) position of the embedded clause. It is the coindexation of the Major Subject with the predicate-internal position that gives rise to the illusion of non-locality. I then compare the analysis with an alternative base-generation analysis. While the two are roughly equal in terms of coverage, only the Major Subject raising analysis is able to account for properties of the raised nominal that could only have been determined in the embedded clause.},

It is shown that ka can appear in a wider range of structural positions than mo can. This difference receives explana- tion on semantic grounds. I propose that mo is a generalized quantifier. More specifically, I assume that the phrase headed by mo is of type hha; ti; ti. Because of its type, mo cannot appear in certain structural positions without causing type mismatch. Ka, on the other hand, is a choice function variable of type ha=t; ai, and due to its type, its distribution is not as restricted. One of the consequences of this analysis is that there are no quantifier raising or type shifting operations in Japanese that would adequately obviate type mismatch.},

The empirical study focuses on the structure of DP and its linearization in various constructions. It is shown that the Definiteness Effect (DE) can be attributed to the failure to linearize the DP in unaccusatives. The systematic lack of the DE in some languages (Arabic, Hebrew, and Romanian), unexpected in previous analyses, is due to the morphological N-to-D raising (fusion), therefore satisfying the linearization condition. Furthermore, cross-linguistic evidence is given to show that D can be attracted out of DP for feature checking, rendering transitive DP arguments well-formed.},

  title = {Alignment and {{Word Order}} in {{Old Japanese}}},
  volume = {18},
  abstract = {This paper argues that Old Japanese (eighth century) had split alignment, with nominative-accusative alignment in main clauses and active alignment in nominalized clauses. The main arguments for active alignment in nominalized clause come from ga-marking of active subjects and the distribution of two verbal prefixes: i-for active predicates and sa- for inactive predicates (cf. Yanagida, In: Hasegawa (ed.) Nihongo no shubun gensho [Main clause phenomena in Japanese], 2007b). We review the treatment of non-accusative alignment and argue that active alignment should be analyzed as as a distinct type. We propose a formal analysis of active alignment in nominalized clauses in Old Japanese. The external argument is assigned inherent case, spelled out as ga, in situ in Spec, v. Object arguments are licensed by several distinct mechanisms, including incorporation (Yanagida, In: Miyamoto (ed.) MIT Working Papers in Linguistics, 2007a) and case assignment by a functional head above vP. The latter accounts for the distinctive O wo S ga V word order of OJ nominalized clauses noted by Yanagida (J. of East Asian Linguistics, 2006). Inability to assign object case is a property of [nominal] v, as proposed by Miyagawa (Structure and case marking in Japanese. Syntax and Semantics, vol. 22, 1989). We discuss the diachronic origins of the OJ active alignment system and point out that it exemplifies a cross-linguistically attested pattern of non-accusative alignment in clauses that originate from nominalizations.},

  title = {Word {{Order}} and {{Clause Structure}} in {{Early Old Japanese}}},
  volume = {15},
  abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to show that there is a striking difference in word order between Modern Japanese and Early Old Japanese. Early Old Japanese lacks the canonical transitive pattern [Subject-ga Object-o V]. The basic word order in Early Old Japanese is [Subject-ga/no Object-\O{} V], in which the subject is marked by the genitive ga or no and a morphologically unmarked object must appear immediately adjacent to the verb. When the object is marked by wo, it is obligatorily moved over a subject, resulting in [Object-wo Subject-ga/no V]. Following Miyagawa (1989) and Miyagawa and Ekida (2003), I argue that a bare object is assigned abstract case under the strict adjacency requirement, but that wo in Early Old Japanese does not function as an accusative case. The particle wo differs crucially from the case particle o in Modern Japanese in that it marks not only the direct object of a transitive verb, but all kinds of internal arguments of both transitive and intransitive verbs. Furthermore, wo conveys a definite interpretation. An element marked by wo moves to a particular structural position, namely Spec(vP) or Spec(CP), where it is assigned definite/topic interpretations.},

It gives rise to different meanings by applying maximality to a contextually determined plural set. This could be a set of covers, a set of focus-induced alternatives, or a set of degrees ordered on a scale. This analysis also connects dou in these contexts with dou in environments that license polarity items, as discussed in Giannakidou and Cheng (J Semant 23: 135\textendash{}183, 2006).},

We then demonstrate in Experiment 2 that this factor can be used to prime inverse scope interpretations. To remove pragmatics from the equation to the extent possible, we show in Experiment 3 that the same effect can be achieved via semantic priming. Our results represent the first clear evidence for priming of the abstract logico-syntactic structures underlying these interpretations and, thus, highlight the importance of language processing alongside pragmatic reasoning during children's linguistic development.},

  title = {Assumptions about the {{Structure}} of {{Coordination}}},
  abstract = {In this article some empirical arguments for maintaining the basic notion of structural symmetry in coordination (williams 1977, 1978, 1981) are presented. It is argued that a symmetric approach is actually better able to address the matter of derivational economy in a minimalist sense. Though coordination can be asymmetric, this occurs in a less than optimal derivation, for instance when coordination as a structural and semantic principle breaks down for some reason. In that case asymmetry is the default when coordination fails, and the phrase structure remains simplex. In most coordinate constructions, it is argued, symmetric coordiantion is maintained as a structural principle, and as such it forms a unified whole with the semantics of coordination, which is always symmetric. In the approach to coordinate structure presented here, conjuncts are right-adjoined at lexical insertion, i.e. they do not occur in derived postiions such as Specifier positions. A conjunct is a projection of its own head category, and this projection is right-adjoined without the generation of a maximal projection of hte conjucntion (there is no \&P). In right adjunction all conjuncts are hierarchically equal, though linear precedence produces certain binding asymmetries. A coordinating conjunction, when it occurs, is left-adjoined to the last conjunct. Features percolate freely between matching (symmetric) conjuncts and form the basis of various types of agreement and ellipses. In the case of clausal conjuncts, one clause must complete lexical insertion and overt movement before another conjunct can be generated. Empirical evidence is presented from subject-verb, verb-object and pronoun-antecedent agreement, gapping, ATB and parasitic gap constructions, mismatched conjuncts and "asymmetric" cases of coordination.},

French being intermediate between English (which rarely allows noun-drop) and Spanish (which freely allows it) with respect to the richness of their respective morphological systems, it provides a fertile testing ground for various agreement-based analyses of noun-drop. We conclude, along with Snyder, Senghas, \& Inman (2001) that agreement is not a factor in the licensing of these constructions. Moreover, limitations on the occurrence of this phenomenon (i.e., not all adjective types allow it) in French lead us to propose that semantic, rather than syntactic, factors are responsible for noun-drop in French, i.e., partitivity and atomization (in the sense of Bouchard 2002). This in turn assigns the determiner a more important role than had previously been assumed in the licensing of noun-drop. Ultimately, our analysis illustrates how child language can be used to discriminate between competing analyses of a given syntactic process.},

A unified analysis of the two languages is developed in this paper, using certain proposals of Minimalism and a licensing principle which requires that both the specifier and the head position of a projection must be filled. In addition to the null subject pattern, Finnish and Hebrew differe both from traditional pro-drop and from nonpro-drop languages in the patterning of the agreement paradigm; the analysis developed here provides a connection between the mixed null subject pattern and the special agreement paradigm.},

Data from Modern Hebrew exemplify that output-based prosodic restrictions form the basis of the unusual root-and-pattern behavior generally attributed to Semitic morphology. Rather than relying on idiosyncratic elements such as the consonantal root, this paper argues that universal constraints demanding that prosodic structures meet both minimality and maximality requirements explain the range of prosodic markedness effects observed in Semitic languages. As a further consequence of this approach, constraints on the realization of affixal material are motivated, explaining root-and-pattern morphology as melodic over-writing without recourse to the consonantal root. As a result, Semitic morphology can be viewed as arising from a language-particular combination of cross-linguistic and universal constraints.},

  title = {Minimal {{Restrictions}} on {{Basque Movements}}},

  abstract = {This article discusses a long-known restriction on Wh-movement in Basque, describing it in terms of barriers. In essence, Wh-movement is impossible across a morphologically-expressed specifier, while it is possible across a corresponding null pronominal. It is argued that this restriction holds more generally for any category that licenses null arguments in pro-drop languages. The paper then accounts for the descriptive restriction in Minimalist terms, deriving barrier requirements from independently required derivational dynamics. In particular, an attracted feature F, related to a functional projection K containing 'heavy' agreement, forces an ancillary morphological repair to apply to the category alpha which F comes from. This morphological repair results in K being spelled-out and consequently frozen (as a sort of compound) for further syntactic computation; islands (or barriers) emerge as a consequence of the Spell-out of K. An account is also provided for why A-movement is possible across a morphologically-expressed specifier (in contrast to A'-movement). Apart from having consequences for the proper statement of various mechanisms assumed within the Minimalist Program, the analysis constitutes strong evidence for this system in its radically derivational variant (with Spell-out applying repeatedly when convergence demands it), inasmuch as it provides a natural way to understand barriers as a dynamic property of derivational syntax.},

In Lushootseed, roots tend to permit codas and stressed schwa, while affixes avoid both. The differences between the three Lushootseed reduplicants follow from the assumptions that the CVC-reduplicative morpheme is a root, while CV- and -VC are affixes. In addition to confirming the central tenets of GTT, this study uncovers a markedness implication for reduplication: if a langauge has unmarked root reduplicants it will aslo have unmarked affix reduplicants.},

Overt movement is due to the presence of a (strong) Focus feature on the K-word. In the absence of such a feature, a K-word remains in situ and can only be interpreted as a PI. The set of possible binders that licnese PI includes the negation, question operators, conditional complementizers, modal verbs and modal particles. The properties of PIs are satisfied by covert dependency formation. This dependency does not involve abstract movement but rather a binding relation. More precisely, polarity itmes and their operators form a head-to-head dependency sensitive to strong and weak islands.},

In this paper we first claim that kake mominalization should recognize the two meanings, the "halfway" reading adn the inception reading, for its accurate description. Based on the observation that the "halfway" rading occurs with (transitive) accomplishment verbs while the inception rading is possible with any verb, we further claim that telicity is a key notion to account for the "halfway" reading. Moreover, we argue that the "halfway" interpretation requires that an event extend over an interval so that a halfway point of the even can be measured. Achievement verbs, although telic, denote a punctual event, and therefore the nominal cannot receive the "halfway" reading: it can only have the inception reading. We also demostrate that telicity can be invoked by contextual information. Our analysis overcomes the problems that Kishimoto' smacrorole-based analysis faces and yet subsumes its generalization: the lowest ranking nonagent macrorole argument generally serves as the dewlimiter of the action denoted by the verb.},

  volume = {10},
  abstract = {In Japanese, the high vowels [i, u] become devoiced when they occur between voiceless segments, e.g., [kitai] 'expectation'. When a word contains a sequence of devoiceable syllables, however, not all high vowels are devoiced, and some are necessarily voiced: [kisitsu] 'termperament', [sekisitsu] 'room made of rock'. These words contain two consecutive devoiceable vowels, but only one of them, either the first or the second vowel in the sequence, is devoiced. Previous studies have claimed that it is impossible to predict which vowels are to be devoiced in consecutive devoiceable syllables. In this paper, I argue that devoicing sites are predictable when we understand the conflicting factors at work. Crucially, I argue that devoiced vowels are specified for the features [+spread glottis], departing from the traditional phonological analysis of Japanese vowel devoicing (e.g., McCawley (1968)), which considers devoicing as an assimilation of the feature [-voice]. I further propose several constraints on the sitribution of the feature [+s.g.]. I show that the locus of devoicing in consecutive devoicing environments is determined by the interaticon of these constraints. The analysis is couched in Optimality Theory (Prince and Smolensky (1993)).},

It is further argued that only nouns may enter into unselective binding since they are the sole providers of non-pronominal variables. Adverbs, in contrast, are intrinsic operators and must move to create variables (i.e., traces left behind by movement). Together with the working hypothesis that operator features are not universally strong, the noun-adverb distinction providews a straightfowrad account of LF argument-adjunct asymmetries, reinventing the insights of Huang (1982) and Lasnik and Saito (1984, 1992) in a minimalist fashion.},

This is the case with English, where cardinal subjects are commonplace.

By contrast, manner and instrumental wh's are both analyzed as vP-modifiers, which translate into restrictive predicates of the underlying event argument associated with the peripheral area of vP. These wh-expressions differ dramatically with respect to their behavior towards locality principles. On the one hand, only instrumental wh, but not manner wh, may escape from strong island effects and weak intervention effects. On the other, they both observe strong intervention effects, triggered by negation and A-not-A questions.

  abstract = {This article argues that the relation between syntactic XPs and phonological phrases is subject to a constraint. Wrap-XP, that demands that each XP be contained in a phonological phrase. Wrap-XP is argued to interact with the constraints on edge alignment proposed by Selkirk (1986, 1995), with a constraint against recursive structure, and with a constraint aligning an edge of a focus with a pohnological phrase. Wrap-XP is intended to replace, and improve on, an earlier proposal by Hale and Selkirk (1987) to the effect that lexical government plays a role in the syntax-prosody mapping. The languages discussed in more detail are Tohono O'odham, Kimatuumbi, and Chichewa.},

  abstract = {This paper puts forward a unified theory of 'standard' and 'transparent' free relatives, and thus departs from earlier anlyses of the latter, which have consistently viewed them as radically different 'constructions'. It is argued. partly on the basis of strengthened and refined old arguments and partly on the basis of novel ones, that the two kinds of free relatives are unified by the following core of properties: (i) they are complex XPs, consisting of an overt CP adn a null head (with internal structure), (ii) they are multi-categorial, and (iii) their semantic interpretation involves the application of a uniqueness operator to a set obtained by abstraction. The special effects associated with transparent free relatives result from the following combination of factors (which may be encountered separately, in which case they do not induce transparency effects): (a) the $\backslash$emphwh-element in [Spec, CP] binds the subject of a small clause, (b) the small clause is of the equative-specificational type, (c) abstraction at the CP level applies to an unrestricted property variable, and (d) the $\backslash$emphwh-element is syntacticially and semantically underspecified. The cumulative effect of these factors is that the small-clause predicate is perceived as, and in certain ways also functions as, a syntactici and semantic 'nucleus' of the comlex XP and thus exhibits head-like properties.},

  abstract = {Appositive relative clauses differ in some essential respects from restrictive relative clauses. I argue that appositive relatives and appositions can be put together as a third class of coordination denoting specification. Thus, an appositive relative is a specifying conjunct to the visible antecedent. It is a semifree relative with a pronominal head that is normally empty. Therefore, its internal syntax is equivalent to that of restrictive relatives; hence, there is one syntax for both types of relative clauses. In essence, it is the context of specifying coordination that accounts for the different behavior of appositive relatives. In the light of this analysis, the properties of appositive relatives (as opposed to restrictive relatives) are systematically reviewed.},

The major empirical problem concerns the difference betseen two pronominal forms found in German: personal pronouns and so-called d-pronouns, which are also used as relative pronouns. The major theoretical question concerns the nature of relative pronouns in general. I will argue that d-pronouns are definite determiners, i.e., full Determiner Phrases (DPs) containing an empty NP whereas personal pronouns are merely the spell out of phi features (AgrD) not containing an NP-projection. This will allow us to account for the distributional differences between the two forms. In addiiton, I will argue for a restriction on Operator-variable chains that will derive the fact that only d-words but not personal pronouns can be used as relative pronouns in a language that makes use of the a'-movement strategy for relativization. It will also follows that relativization without A'-movement is possible with either a personal pronoun or a gap occupying the relativized position.},

At the same time, modifying these theories to incorporate persistence makes them incompatible with the use of situations for contextual restriction [Kratzer (2004).

Restricitons on head movement, superraising, and wh-movement follow from well-established principles and mechanisms made explicit in recent minimalist work. It is furthermore argued that Chomsky's FORM CHAIN mechanism must be decomposed into a "trace" insertion mechanism and a (long distance) movement mechanism, where the inermediate "traces" are inserted before the movement takes place, in accordance with strict cyclicity. This resolves the conflict between the "fewest steps" requirement and the "shortext move" requirement in Chomsky (1993).},

This squib presents a case of diverse ``repairs'' in response to a marked structure\textemdash{}labial $\backslash$ldots labial sequences\textemdash{}created by um-infixation in stems beginning with (or, in some cases, merely containing) labial consonants in Austronesian languages. We review several strategies, which for the most part do not cluster according to subfamilies: tolerance, gaps, loss of stem consonant, loss of infix nasality, stem dissimilation, infix dissimilation, prefixation, and non-realization of infix. The evidence indicates that avoidance of these sequences applies only within the root-and-infix domain, and only in derived environments. This diversity of repairs seems unexpected if changes should be perceptually minimal; we suggest possible explanations.},

  volume = {83},
  abstract = {A current controversy in phonological theory concerns the explanation of crosslinguistic tendencies. It is often assumed that crosslinguistic tendencies are explained by mental bias: a pattern is common because it is favored by learners/speakers. But work by Blevins and colleagues in EVOLUTIONARY PHONOLOGY has argued that many crosslinguistic tendencies can be explained without positing such bias. This would mean that crosslinguistic tendencies cannot be unproblematically used as evidence about the mental machinery that humans bring to learning and using language. In response, many researchers have looked at different types of data, such as processing, learning of real and artificial languages, and literary invention. This article presents another type of data: extension of native-language phonology to words with novel phonological structure, in this case infixation in Tagalog into loanwords with novel initial consonant clusters. The data come from a written corpus and a survey. Tagalog speakers' treatment of these clusters parallels Fleischhacker's crosslinguistic findings of cluster splittability. This article argues that explaining the data requires attributing to Tagalog speakers phonetic knowledge and a bias about how to apply that knowledge.},

  volume = {28},
  abstract = {This paper presents a case of patterned exceptionality. The case is Tagalog nasal substitution, a phenomenon in which a prefix-final nasal fuses with a stem-initial obstruent. The rule is variable on a word-by-word basis, but its distribution is phonologically patterned, as shown through dictionary and corpus data. Speakers appear to have implicit knowledge of the patterning, as shown through experimental data and loan adaptation. A grammar is proposed that reconciles the primacy of lexical information with regularities in the distribution of the rule. Morphologically complex words are allowed to have their own lexical entries, whose use is preferred to on-the-fly morphological concatenation. The grammar contains lower-ranked markedness constraints that govern the behavior of novel words. Faithfulness for lexicalized full words is ranked high, so that an established word will have a stable pronunciation. But when a word is newly coined through affixation, the outcome varies according the lexical trends. A crucial aspect of the proposal is that the ranking of the ''subterranean'' markedness constraints can be learned despite training data in which all words are pronounced faithfully, using Boersma's (1997, 1998) Gradual learning algorithm. The paper also shows, by summarizing the rule's behavior in related languages, that the same constraints, in different rankings, seem to be at work even in languages reported to lack variation.},

Facts of this kind, also observed for American Sign Language (ASL) and other sign languages, have led some authors (Friedman, among others) to conclude that these languages, on a par with spoken languages like Chinese, lack grammatical tense. Neidle et al. and Jacobowitz and Stokoe have challenged this view for ASL and have argued that ASL sentences contain tense markers. I present some data showing that LIS verbs inflect for tense. I argue, moreover, that the apparent lack of tense inflection when LIS past and future time adverbs are present is due to the fact that these adverbs shift the s-point and that LIS past and future tenses are absolute tenses. I provide a formal account of the LIS tense system based on these assumptions. The account is implemented in Heim's analysis of tense.},

These theories differ in more than one way. Landman regards the progressive as an intensional operator, whicl Parsons doesn't. Moreover, Landman and Parsons disagree on what uninflected predicates denote. For Landman, cross the street has in its denotation complete events of crossing the street; the aspectual contribution of English simple past (perfective aspect) is the identity function. For Parsons, both complete and incomplete eents of crossing the street can be in the denotation of the base VP; perfective aspect restricts its denotation to the events that culminate. I present a version of Parson's theory that avoids the problems raised by Landman, in particular the problem posed for Parsons by creation verbs. The reparied version and Landman's theory still differ in the way they analyze uninflected predicates. I present evidence form Slavic languages that both etheories are needed. Finally, I discuss some evidence that may favor one or the other approach to the semantics of the English progressive.},
