\section{Introduction}

The puzzle is the following. In mismatching free relatives we sometimes see \tit{met wat} and sometimes \tit{waarmee}.

\ex.
\ag. Ik heb gekocht waar jij mee schildert.\\
 I have bought where you with paint\\
 `I bought what you are painting with.'
\bg. *Ik heb gekocht met wat jij schildert.\\
 I have bought with what you paint\\
 `I bought what you are painting with.'

\ex.
\ag. *Ik schilder waarmee jij hebt gekocht.\\
 I paint {where with} you have bought\\
 `I paint with what you bought.'
\bg. Ik schilder met wat jij hebt gekocht.\\
 I paint with what you have bought\\
 `I paint with what you bought.'

A few things should be noticed here. First, \tit{met wat} and \tit{waarmee} appear in a complementary distribution. Second, \tit{waar} in \tit{waarmee} means \tit{where}, but \tit{waarmee} does not express a location. Third, the preposition \tit{met} changes into \tit{mee}.

This paper: \tit{waarmee} is the default realization of an instrumental when all features form a constituent. If not, then \tit{met wat}. The \tit{r} in ʀ-pronouns does not necessarily express \tsc{locative}, in \tit{waarmee} is only expresses \tsc{thing}. The change of \tit{met} into \tit{mee} is a reflex of stranded features/a different spellout of features.

Unmarked examples are constructed and have been verified by native speakers.



\section{Conditions for \tit{waarmee} and \tit{met wat} to appear}

Repeating the first example from the introduction. What we see here is embedded clause verb requires its object to be an instrumental and the main clause verb wants an accusative object. \tit{waarmee} is correct weer, \tit{met wat} is not.

\ex.
\ag. Ik heb gekocht waar jij mee schildert.\\
 I have bought where you with paint\\
 `I bought what you are painting with.'
\bg. *Ik heb gekocht met wat jij schildert.\\
 I have bought with what you paint\\
 `I bought what you are painting with.'

 \tit{Waarmee} is ʀ-pronoun, a term introduced by \cite{riemsdijk1978}. ʀ-pronouns are not specific to the inanimate relative pronouns. No inanimate pronominal elements in Dutch is able to act as the object of a preposition. They are all replaced by an ʀ-pronoun. As suggested by the name, ʀ-pronouns always contain the morpheme \tit{r}.

 Dutch has the personal pronouns \tit{haar} `her', \tit{hem} `him' and \tit{het} `it' that can be used as animate and inanimate objects of verbs, as illustrated in \ref{ex:objverb}.

 \ex. Objects of verbs \label{ex:objverb}
 \ag. Ik zie haar/hem.\\
  I see her/him\\
  `I see her/him.'\label{ex:aniobj}
 \bg. Ik zie 't.\\
  I see it\\
  `I see it.'\label{ex:inaniobj}

The example in \ref{ex:prepani} shows that for animate objects the same pronouns (\tit{haar} `her' and \tit{hem} `him') appear as objects of prepositions. However, the inanimate personal pronoun \tit{het} `it' cannot be used as an object of a preposition, shown in \ref{ex:prephet}. Instead, an ʀ-pronoun appears. This is illustrated in \ref{ex:preper}.




\ex. Objects of prepositions \label{ex:objprep}
\ag. Ik schilder samen met haar/hem.\\
 I paint together with her/him\\
 `I am painting together with her/him.'\label{ex:prepani}
\bg. *Ik schilder met het.\\
 I paint with a brush\\
 `I am painting with it.'\label{ex:prephet}
\bg. Ik schilder er-mee.\\
 I paint \tit{er}-with\\
 `I am painting with it.'\label{ex:preper}

\tit{met} is not the only preposition with which this happens.

\ex.
\ag. Ik zit er-op.\\
 I sit it-on\\
 `I am sitting on it.
\bg. *Ik zit op 't.\\
 I sit on it\\
 `I am sitting on it.

 \ex.
 \ag. Hij zwemt er-in.\\
  He swims it-in\\
  `He is swimming in it.'
 \bg. *Hij zwemt in 't.\\
  He swims in it\\
  `He is swimming in it.'

\tit{Waarmee} and not \tit{met wat} also appears in other contexts. \ref{ex:headless} shows matching headless free relatives, \ref{ex:headed} shows headed relatives, \ref{ex:wh} gives wh-questions. The use of \tit{met wat} is ungrammatical here, and \tit{waarmee} should be chosen.

\ex. Matching headless relatives\label{ex:headless}
\ag. Ik schilder waar jij ook mee schildert.\\
 I paint \tit{w-aa-r} you also with paint\\
 `I am painting with what you are painting with too.'
\bg. *Ik schilder met wat jij ook schildert.\\
 I paint with what you also paint\\
 `I am painting with what you are painting with too.'

\ex. Headed relatives\label{ex:headed}
\ag. Ik schilder met de kwast waar-mee jij ook schildert.\\
 I paint with the brush \tit{w-aa-r}-with you also paint\\
 `I am painting with the brush that you are painting with too.'
\bg. *Ik schilder met de kwast met wat jij ook schildert.\\
 I paint with the brush with what you also paint\\
 `I am painting with the brush that you are painting with too.'

\ex. Wh-question\label{ex:wh}
\ag.  Waar-mee schilder jij?\\
 \tit{W-aa-r}-with paint you\\
 `What are you painting with?'
\bg. *Met wat schilder jij?\\
 With what paint you\\
 `What are you painting with?'

What this shows is that in principle \tit{waarmee} is used, it is the default. What is special about the examples in which \tit{met wat} is used then? I suggest that it is the constituency. \tit{Waarmee} needs to be a constituent. I repeated the \tit{waarmee} example. Here \tit{waar} and \tit{mee} are both part of the embedded clause. I show later that at some point in the derivation they were part of a proper constituent. They formed a constituent without any other elements.

\ex.
\ag. Ik heb gekocht [waar jij mee schildert].\\
 I have bought where you with paint\\
 `I bought what you are painting with.'
\bg. *Ik heb gekocht [met wat jij schildert].\\
 I have bought with what you paint\\
 `I bought what you are painting with.'

 Now I repeat the \tit{met wat} example. Here \tit{wat} is part of the embedded clause but \tit{met} is not. It belongs to the main clause. An embedded clause is finished before the main clause is built. At no point in the derivation can \tit{met} \tit{wat} form a proper constituent.

\ex.
\ag. *Ik schilder [waar]mee [jij hebt gekocht].\\
 I paint {where with} you have bought\\
 `I paint with what you bought.'
\bg. Ik schilder met [wat jij hebt gekocht].\\
 I paint with what you have bought\\
 `I paint with what you bought.'

There are actually more examples of \tit{wat} following \tit{met} in which \tit{met} and \tit{wat} do not form a constituent without containing any other elements. First, \tit{wat} is an indefinite that takes an NP complement, and only then it is combined with the \tit{met}. Second, \tit{wat} combines with \tit{voor} and then combines with an NP complement en then with \tit{met}. \tit{Met} and \tit{wat} are never a constituent to the exclusion of everything else.

\ex.
\ag. Ik wil graag thee met wat suiker.\\
 I want please tea with some sugar\\
 `I would like to have tea with some sugar.'
\bg. [Met [wat [voor [potloden]]] teken jij?\\
 with what for pencils draw you\\
 `What kind of pencils do you with?'

In conclusion:

\ex.
\a. *[[met] [wat]] $\rightarrow$ [waarmee]
\b. [met [wat X]]
\b. [met [wat [X]]]




\section{Connecting \tit{wat} to \tit{waar} and \tit{met} to \tit{mee}}

So, \tit{waarmee} and \tit{met wat} realize the same features but their spellouts differ.

\ex.
\ag. Ik heb gekocht [waar jij mee schildert].\\
 I have bought where you with paint\\
 `I bought what you are painting with.'
\bg. Ik schilder met [wat jij hebt gekocht].\\
 I paint with what you have bought\\
 `I paint with what you bought.'

A few things should be noted here. First, position of the elements: the regular pronoun follows the adposition and the ʀ-pronoun precedes the preposition. Second, the shape of the wh-pronoun: the ʀ-pronoun differs from the non-ʀ-pronoun in the lengthening of the vowel that the final consonant is \tit{r}. Third, the shape of the adposition: \tit{met} and \tit{tot} change in \tit{mee} and \tit{toe} when they combine with ʀ-pronouns.

Now let's look at it like this: \tit{waarmee} realizes particular features. Say \tit{waar} expresses A and B and \tit{mee} expresses C and D. Say, A B C and D. \tit{met wat} realizes the same features. Saying that \tit{wat} also realizes A and B and \tit{met} also C and D misses the point of having different realizations. So instead, say \tit{wat} only realizes A and \tit{met} realizes B, C and D. Or \tit{wat} realizes A, B and C and \tit{met} only realizes D. In both cases all features are expresses, but they are distributed differently, allowing for different realizations.\footnote{I did not address the ordering difference of the elements. Yes, this can lead to a difference in meaning.

\ex.
\ag. Ik klim in de boom.\\
 I climb in the tree\\
 `I am climbing in the tree.'
\bg. Ik klim de boom in\\
 I climb the tree in\\
 `I am climbing into the tree.'

Here, however, I will argue that the movement is driven by spellout and is meaningless.}

\begin{table}[ht]
	\center
	\caption {Distribution options}
	\begin{minipage}{0.27\linewidth}
		\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{cccc}
		\toprule
    \tsc{a}   & \tsc{b}            & \tsc{c}   & \tsc{d}                           \\
		\midrule
    \multicolumn{2}{c}{\tit{met}}  & \multicolumn{2}{c}{\cellcolor{Gray}\tit{wat}} \\
    \tit{mee} & \multicolumn{3}{c}{\cellcolor{Gray}\tit{waar}}                     \\
    \multicolumn{3}{c}{\tit{mee}}               & \cellcolor{Gray}{\tit{waar}}     \\
    \bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{minipage}
\end{table}

I will argue for the last option, that \tit{met} spells out fewer features than \tit{mee}. The main argument for that comes from the fact that Dutch is a non-preposition stranding language, so prepositions cannot be moved out of the PP. Also, you cannot move the complement of a P to its spec, but you can subextract from them (Abels). And I show that ʀ-pronouns behave like clitic in how high they move.

In a nutshell, if all features are merged at once, we will always get an ʀ-pronoun. Due to spellout driven movement the ʀ-pronoun strands the features to be realizes by a preposition and a little more. The ʀ-pronoun is a clitic and moves high. The preposition + a little more realizes as \tit{mee} in case of \tit{waarmee}. Now if the features are not merged all at once, the regular spellout driven movements cannot take place, and we see \tit{met wat}. So, the answer of how constituency connects to change in phonological form lies in one of the core assumptions of nanosyntax: phrasal spellout spells out constituents.

\ex.
\a. \tit{waar} = w + a + r
\b. \tit{wat} = w + a + t

So the difference betwween \tit{t} and \tit{r} was actually the only difference we need to account for.

Dutch is a non P-stranding language.

\ex.
\ag. Met wie heb jij gedanst?\\
 with who have you danced\\
 `Whom did you dance with?'
\bg. *Wie heb jij gedanst met?\\
 who have you danced with\\
 `Whom did you dance with?'

Abels shows that extraction from a PP is not categorically excluded. It happens in Slavic.

--examples here--

What if ʀ-pronouns are actually clitic? And they pattern with Slavic in that they clitic can never follow Ps.

Do we have more reasons to believe that ʀ-pronouns are clitics? The non-wh ʀ-pronouns in Dutch are able to move very high, just like clitics and unlike regular pronouns in Dutch.\footnote{\ref{ex:hemaan} can also be excluded by saying that \tit{aan} and \tit{hem} cannot split.}

\ex.
\ag. Ik heb veel geld aan de badkamer uitgegeven.\\
 I have much money on the bathroom spent\\
 `I spent a lot of money on the bathroom.'
\bg. Ik heb er veel geld aan uitgegeven.\\
 I have there much money on spent\\
 `I spent a lof of money on it.'

\ex.
\ag. Ik heb veel geld aan mijn zoon uitgegeven.\\
 I have much money on my son spent\\
 `I spent a lof of money on my son'
\bg. Ik heb veel geld aan hem uitgegeven.\\
 I have much money on him spent\\
 `I spent a lot of money on him.'
\bg. *Ik heb \tbf{hem} veel geld aan uitgegeven.\\
 I have him much money on spent\\
 `I spent a lof of money on it.'\label{ex:hemaan}
\z.
\z.

This has shown that \tit{er} is small, smaller than regular pronouns. So we go for this option:

\begin{table}[ht]
	\center
	\caption {\tit{er} < \tit{'t}}
	\begin{minipage}{0.27\linewidth}
		\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{cccc}
		\toprule
    \tsc{a}   & \tsc{b}            & \tsc{c}   & \tsc{d}                           \\
		\midrule
    \multicolumn{2}{c}{\tit{met}}  & \multicolumn{2}{c}{\cellcolor{Gray}\tit{wat}} \\
    \multicolumn{3}{c}{\tit{mee}}               & \cellcolor{Gray}{\tit{waar}}     \\
    \bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{minipage}
\end{table}

As a result of \tit{waar} being small, \tit{mee} becomes big. And \tit{mee} spells out more features than \tit{met}.

Now the difference in distribution between \tit{met wat} and \tit{waarmee} is going to follow from spellout. If we get higher than dative case, we need prepositions. Making prepositions is a very 'costly' operation in the langauge, it is the last resort option in the spellout procedure. Dutch also has forms that are not only prepositions, but can also function as postpositions. They are less 'costly'. To avoid building a complex specifier, different spellout options are used. That is why we get the \tsc{r}-pronoun in the picture. \tsc{r}-pronouns can combine with these postpositions.


\section{Taking \tit{waarmee} and \tit{met wat} apart}

\tit{'t} `it' from \ref{ex:entryt} can be used as subject, direct object and indirect object.

\ex.
\ag. 't Staat in de hal.\\
 \tsc{3sg.n.nom} stands in the hallway\\
 `It is standing in the hallway.'
\bg. Ik zie 't.\\
 I see \tsc{3sg.n.acc}\\
 `I see it.'
\bg. Ik heb 't een klap gegeven.\\
 I have \tsc{3sg.n.dat} a hit given\\
 `I hit it.'

 Pronouns in other genders alternate between nominative (non-oblique) and accusative/dative (oblique) in these contexts.

 \ex.
 \ag. Hij staat in de hal.\\
  \tsc{3sg.m.nom} stands in the hallway\\
  `He is standing in the hallway.'
 \bg. Ik zie hem.\\
  I see \tsc{3sg.m.acc}\\
  `I see it.'
 \bg. Ik heb hem een klap gegeven.\\
  I have \tsc{3sg.m.acc} a hit given\\
  `I hit him.'

\ex. \begin{forest} boom
[\tsc{dat}P
    [\tsc{f}3]
    [\tsc{acc}P
        [\tsc{f}2]
        [\tsc{nom}P
            [\tsc{f}1]
            [\tsc{thingP}
                [\tsc{thing}, roof]
            ]
        ]
    ]
]
{\draw (.east) node[right]{⇔ \tit{(ə)t}}; }
\end{forest}\label{ex:entryt}

\tit{Er} can be used as a locative.

\exg. Ik ben er al geweest.\\
I am there already been\\
`I have already been there.'

\ex. \begin{forest} boom
[\tsc{loc}P
[\tsc{location}]
    [\tsc{thngP}
        [\tsc{thing}, roof]
    ]
]
{\draw (.east) node[right]{⇔ \tit{(ə)r}}; }
\end{forest}\label{ex:entryr}

\tit{Met} can be used for as instrumental or comitative.

\exg. Ik dans met hem.\\
 I dance with him\\
 `I am dancing with him.'

\ex. \begin{forest} boom
[\tsc{com}P
    [\tsc{f}5]
    [\tsc{ins}P
        [\tsc{f}4, roof]
    ]
]
{\draw (.east) node[right]{⇔ \tit{met}}; }
\end{forest}\label{ex:entrymet}

Either way, it combines with accusative/dative (oblique), which can be seen on the pronouns. But only for the comitative, because for the instrumental we are getting an ʀ-pronoun. Full DPs do not show any marking, leading me to postulate the zero marker up to the dative.

\ex.
\ag. Ik dans met de man.\\
 I dance with the man\\
 `I am dancing with the man.'
\bg. Ik schilder met een kwast.\\
 I paint with een brush\\
 `I am painting with een brush.'

\ex. \begin{forest} boom
[\tsc{datP}
   [\tsc{f}3]
   [\tsc{acc}P
       [\tsc{f}2]
       [\tsc{nom}P
           [\tsc{f}1]
           [\phantom{x}]
       ]
   ]
]
{\draw (.east) node[right]{⇔ \tit{∅}}; }
\end{forest}

So \tit{met} expresses \tsc{f}4, and \tit{(ə)r} expresses \tsc{thing} and \tsc{f}1 to \tsc{f}1. \tit{(ə)r} only expresses \tsc{thing}. \tit{Ermee} and \tit{met 't} express the same features, which leaves \tsc{f}1 to \tsc{f}4 for \tit{mee}.

Spellout

\ex. Merge F and
 \a. Spell out FP
 \b. If (a) fails, attempt movement of the spec of the complement of \tsc{f}, and retry (a)
 \b. If (b) fails, move the complement of \tsc{f}, and retry (a)

\ex. Cyclic Override\\
Lexicalisation at a node XP overrides any previous match at a phrase contained in XP.

\ex. Backtracking\\
When spellout fails, go back to the previous cycle, and try the next option for that cycle.

The functional sequence of \tit{ermee}.

\ex. \tsc{f}4 > \tsc{f}3 > \tsc{f}2 > \tsc{f}1 > \tsc{thing}

We start with \tsc{thing}. This is realized as \tit{(ə)r}, because it has less junk than \tit{(ə)t}.

\ex.
\begin{forest} boom
 [\tsc{thingP}
     [\tsc{thing}, roof]
 ]
{\draw (.east) node[right]{⇔ \tit{(ə)r}}; }
\end{forest}

\tsc{f}1 is merged. \tit{(ə)r} is no longer a candidate, but \tit{(ə)t} is. So the spellout is overridden.

\ex. \begin{forest} boom
[\tsc{nom}P
   [\tsc{f}1]
   [\tsc{thingP}
       [\tsc{thing}, roof]
   ]
]
{\draw (.east) node[right]{⇔ \tit{(ə)t}}; }
\end{forest}

\tsc{f}2 is merged, which can still be realizd by \tit{(ə)t}.

\ex. \begin{forest} boom
[\tsc{accP}
   [\tsc{f}2]
   [\tsc{nom}P
       [\tsc{f}1]
       [\tsc{thingP}
           [\tsc{thing}, roof]
       ]
   ]
]
{\draw (.east) node[right]{⇔ \tit{(ə)t}}; }
\end{forest}

Idem for \tsc{f}3.

\ex. \begin{forest} boom
[\tsc{datP}
    [\tsc{f}3]
    [\tsc{accP}
       [\tsc{f}2]
       [\tsc{nom}P
           [\tsc{f}1]
           [\tsc{thingP}

           ]
       ]
    ]
]
{\draw (.east) node[right]{⇔ \tit{(ə)t}}; }
\end{forest}

Now \tsc{f}4 is merged. No candidate for phrasal spellout, no candidate after complement movement.

The next step in the algorithm is backtracking. We try the next option for the cycle in which \tsc{f}3 was merged. This option is complement movement. However, there is no lexical entry that fits, so we try the next option.

The exact same happens for \tsc{f}2.

Now for \tsc{f}1 it is different. There is a candidate when we try complement movemement, namely \tsc{thing} is realized as \tit{(ə)r} and \tsc{f}1 is spelled out as \tit{∅}

\ex. \begin{forest} boom
[\phantom{x}
   [\tsc{thingP}
       [\tsc{thing}, roof]
   ]
   {\draw (.east) node[right]{⇔ \tit{(ə)r}}; }
   [\tsc{nom}P
       [\tsc{f}1]
   ]
   {\draw (.east) node[right]{⇔ \tit{∅}}; }
]
\end{forest}

Merge \tsc{f}2, there is no candidate for phrasal spellout, we try spec to spec movement and get a match:

\ex. \begin{forest} boom
[\phantom{x}
   [\tsc{thingP}
       [\tsc{thing}, roof]
   ]
   {\draw (.east) node[right]{⇔ \tit{(ə)r}}; }
   [\tsc{acc}P
       [\tsc{f}2]
       [\tsc{nom}P
           [\tsc{f}1]
       ]
   ]
   {\draw (.east) node[right]{⇔ \tit{∅}}; }
 ]
\end{forest}

Idem for \tsc{f}3.

\ex. \begin{forest} boom
[\phantom{x}
   [\tsc{thingP}
       [\tsc{thing}, roof]
   ]
   {\draw (.east) node[right]{⇔ \tit{(ə)r}}; }
   [\tsc{dat}P
       [\tsc{f}3]
       [\tsc{acc}P
           [\tsc{f}2]
           [\tsc{nom}P
               [\tsc{f}1]
           ]
       ]
   ]
   {\draw (.east) node[right]{⇔ \tit{∅}}; }
]
\end{forest}

Now \tsc{f}4 is merged. No phrasal spellout, but there is a match after spec-to-spec movement. However, is is not \tit{∅} anymore, but the inserted morpheme is \tit{mee}.

\ex. \begin{forest} boom
[\phantom{x}
    [\tsc{thingP}
       [\tsc{thing}, roof]
    ]
    {\draw (.east) node[right]{⇔ \tit{(ə)r}}; }
    [\tsc{insP}
       [\tsc{f}4]
       [\tsc{dat}P
           [\tsc{f}3]
           [\tsc{acc}P
               [\tsc{f}2]
               [\tsc{nom}P
                   [\tsc{f}1]
               ]
           ]
       ]
    ]
    {\draw (.east) node[right]{⇔ \tit{mee}}; }
]
\end{forest}

Then show here that this does not happen if not all features form a proper constituent. Spellout can just not target a constituent.



Open issues:

\begin{itemize}
  \item I still need to incorporate \tit{a} and \tit{w}. They can either come before case or after it.
  \item Right now I do not capture the formal similarity between \tit{met} and \tit{mee}. I have ideas about that:
  \item Some adpositions do not change shape. They should be usable both as prepositions and postpositions. This should be reflected in their lexical entry. A prediction is that there exist adpositions that cannot be used as postpositions. Examples of that are: \tit{zonder}, \tit{midden}, \tit{sinds}, \tit{rond}, \tit{beneden}.
\end{itemize}
